Donald Trump,"I want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. I’m thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we’re having our convention. I guess you heard that, right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we’re going to defeat the radical socialists. We’re going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, we’re going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason.",(02:45),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That’s great. That’s great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying, ” Oh, maybe he’s in trouble, maybe the economy … ” They’ll do anything. They’ll do anything. I’m sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don’t think so.",(03:39),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I don’t know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don’t think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don’t have the primary, we’ve already won the thing, you know? I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they’ll say, “Horrible language. He used horrible language today.” But we’re doing fantastically.",(04:19),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"There’s never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that’s true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And there’s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he’s running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said, ” Hey, he’s running for the Senate.” And today he just said Super Thursday, he’s looking forward to Super Thursday.",(04:59),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, it’s promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, it’s the never ending wars in the Middle East. We’re taking our soldiers, we’re bringing them back home. We’re not law enforcement. We’re bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don’t want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country.",(05:53),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens",(07:04),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"And all of the things that we’ve done, we’ve wiped out the terrorists, we’ve done so much, and you know what? We’re 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you’ve got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice.",(07:35),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They’re not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.",(08:27),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn’t have that, so he doesn’t have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around.",(08:42),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"They don’t turn, they don’t turn. You notice, they don’t turn. But if there were some kind of trouble in a little corner, anything to make us look bad, that camera would turn like a pretzel. I used to think, you know, modern equipment it can’t turn, but when we would have a protestor, and I must say, I’ll say it out loud, we don’t have too many protesters anymore, do we? [inaudible 00:10:48]. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally?",(10:26),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they’re really working hard, and they’re working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They’re going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they’re going to have something that makes you better, and that’s going to actually take place we think even sooner.",(10:55),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, we’re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We’re working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we’re working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it’s a problem, we’re working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn’t know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, “What do we lose with the regular flu?” They said, “About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people.” I said, “Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that.”",(11:43),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"So I actually told the pharmaceutical companies, “You have to do a little bit better job on that vaccine. Really, have to do a better job on that vaccine.” [inaudible 00:13:28]. Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So we’re working hard on it, and we’re going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, we’re stopping … Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way? All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina.",(13:17),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"But just to finish up, so we’ve made a lot of progress, we’ve really done a great job with it. We’re keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We’re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I’m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. We’ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We’re going to safeguard our people, the United States.",(14:17),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didn’t know. Nobody knew. They’ve never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we’re going to reduce and the severity of what’s happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible.",(15:08),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans.",(15:56),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That’s what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani.",(16:44),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.",(17:32),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, “Super Thursday.” You can’t do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? It would be over, right? I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you can’t, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he’s constantly naming the wrong state. “It’s great to be in the state of Ohio.” No, no, no, I’m sorry, you’re in North Carolina. No, no. Joe! Do you ever see them run up with a sign, “No, no, North Carolina, Joe!” Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it’s a disaster no matter how good you’re doing. We’re in North Carolina! It’s great to be in Idaho! No, you’re in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they’re a little scary.",(17:49),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Did you see [inaudible 00:18:54]? We’re going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, “Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country.” 150 million! That means 50% of our country. That’s a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that? These people would never let me live it down. We can’t make even a little mistake. We can’t make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, it’s headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he’s looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgia’s not in Super Tuesday!",(18:53),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"So many mistakes! You can’t do that when you’re negotiating with China. Can’t do that when you’re negotiating with these countries, can you? Those mistakes would be very tremendous.",(20:00),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy? Can you believe it? Mini Mike. He’s being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it? Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don’t know what’s going on with Fox. But they’re interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history.",(20:22),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Nah, I got to have more. I’d get down real low, but I don’t want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, “Oh,” they all say, “Oh! Do that again where you get down low.” But if I do that again, it’s a copy. It’s a copy! No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though you’re copying yourself. You don’t like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, “That was nice, don’t do it again,” because if it doesn’t work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? Right? We all know. But no, he’s a disaster waiting to happen. He’s a mess.",(20:42),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"No matter which Democrat candidate you’re talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what’s happening, right? It’s being rigged against … It’s sad. It’s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they’re doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state we’re going to win, we’re going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that’s why. Don’t care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo.",(21:37),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"But they’ve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether it’s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas’s plan … By the way, she’s history. She’s history. I came up with that name far too early, I should’ve just waited. But it didn’t matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, “Wow, I just did it to her.”",(22:57),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? They never caught on. In fact, she’ll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesn’t know what to do because you’re not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. She’s the Senator. She’s the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she’s going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see what’s going on over there? Michigan, we’re leading. We’re leading in Wisconsin. We’re leading in Florida. We’re leading-",(23:31),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"… Wisconsin, we’re leading in Florida, we’re leading in South Carolina, we’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in New Hampshire. We’re leading in the great state of Florida that was one of the first ones [inaudible 00:24:19] in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election? One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be… oh, that wasn’t so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warren’s here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike’s plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Don’t worry about it, it’s not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesn’t even know where he is, what he’s doing, or what office he’s running for. Actually, I honestly don’t think he knows what office he’s running for. And it doesn’t matter.",(24:01),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Maybe he gets in, because he’s a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But he’s not going to be running it. Other people are going to. They’re going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But they’re going to be super left radical crazies. They’re going to be super left radical crazies, Joe’s going to be in a home. He’ll be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party.",(25:30),charlotte north

They’re fighting each other, they hate each other, they don’t know what’s going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we’re doing. We know what we’re doing. So we’re thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he’s become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State’s Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey.",(26:25),charlotte north
Lindsey Graham,"Hello, Charlotte. It’s good to be in a place where I don’t have an accent. Mr. President, thank you for being the best Commander in Chief since Ronald Reagan. Thank you for killing the terrorists over there, so they can’t hurt us over here. Thank you for sticking with Judge Kavanaugh. Mr. President, everybody in this room has one thing in common, we all have your back. Mr. President, you are going to kick their ass in November.",(27:59),charlotte north

Now some warriors that really defended us with the impeachment hoax, one of great hoaxes in the history of country, Representative Virginia Foxx, Patrick McHenry, Richard Hudson, Mark Meadows, David Rouzer, Ted Budd. They’re warriors, these guys are unbelievable the way they fight. The last straw, I’ll tell you, I came here and then it probably weren’t scheduled to win, and fake news, CNN and [inaudible 00:30:01] they were all set. They [inaudible 00:30:03]. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn’t even close. They’re great people, and they’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. It’s nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren’t too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael.",(29:12),charlotte north

They’re unbelievable.” I said, “Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time.” She said, the next day she came again. She said, “I saw them again, they’re unbelievable.” I said, “Let me see.” I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you.",(32:05),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. You’re doing a great job, I’ll tell you they’re looking, they’re going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job? It doesn’t matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, “What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don’t.” Look if you win, nobody cares what room you’re in. If you lose, nobody cares what room you’re in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that’s it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, I’m out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money.",(33:00),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"But I never thought we were going to lose. That’s on of the things they like to spread, “Trump felt that he wasn’t going to win.” Oh yeah, I’m running because I [inaudible 00:10:30], that’s not the deal. I mean it’s always possible that you don’t win, but boy I thought we were going to win and we were getting crowds like this actually, to be honest, I think our crowds now are bigger, stronger, and even more enthusiastic. I really think they’re more enthusiastic than ever before. And then there’s two set we’re eight months away, that’s a long, it’s not even our, in case you haven’t heard, we’ve got it made in the primers. For us, we’re not even really political season and we’re getting crowds like this, we were all over the last couple of weeks. We like to troll. We like to go the night before one of their primers. We do a little trolling, it’s called we do a little trolling. Bernie Sanders was very upset, “Why would he be there?” Why? Because I want to win, I want to keep everybody happy. That’s such a good reason. Honestly, when you’re two months or three months out, we’re getting numbers that are unbelievable. Colorado went, we went to Iowa, every place we’ve gone, New Hampshire. Every place we’ve gone, just came out of South Carolina, you saw that. That was an incredible [inaudible 00:35:57]. Every place that we’ve gone, it’s been amazing. I’d also like to recognize, so important, a woman who’s really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she’ll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don’t like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara? How are we doing? How are we doing in the state, are we doing good?",(34:25),charlotte north
Donald Trump,"And we’re doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we’re doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man who’s really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn’t get along, I would not be here. I wouldn’t do this. I think he’s been tremendous. He’s been a tremendous supporter and things that we’ve wanted to do, and fights that we’ve had which were so important, he’s been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he’s been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but he’s going to come up and I’m going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, he’s been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he’s doing great. He’s doing great.

Thom Tillis,"Ladies and gentlemen, you got to start choice, it starts tomorrow, we’re both on the ballot. You need to vote for us so we can go back and do it again, but let me tell you again, we can’t forget what they’re promising you on the other side of the aisle. Bernie Sanders is so liberal, he doesn’t even call himself a democrat, he calls himself a socialist. This President went to the State of the Union and he said, “America will never be a socialist country.” That’s another promise he’s going to keep. Now mind you ladies and gentleman, I want to thank the President for coming back, and I can’t wait to welcome him in August for the RNC Convention. Quiet. Mr. President there was one thing that you said back at the campaign in 2016, it’s the only thing, I just don’t believe it’s happened, have you gotten tired of winning?",(39:09),charlotte north

Donald Trump,"Wow. Hey that’s pretty good, that’s pretty good, Thom. Lot of times we get people up and they just can’t do it. They start breathing bad, they can’t breathe, “Oh help me,” like Bloomberg. Did you see the debate? Huh? She came after him. She’s mean, she’s very mean. She came after him and he started chocking [inaudible 00:41:10] “Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didn’t tell me this was going to happen.” No, that was great Thom. We’re also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. He’s 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George.

Donald Trump,"We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that’s happening, that’s happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before.

And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right? It’s called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there’s no tax to be paid by your children.

The entire democratic field supports [inaudible 00:47:15] sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina?

Donald Trump,"No, we’re looking to do a great job. We need that extra five to get everything solidified. It’s like you take a tree and you plant it, it needs some time to grab on, right? And that’s what we need. We’ve got incredible things that we’ve done. We have things we still can do, but we have done actually much, much more than we even promised we’d do. If you think over [inaudible 00:22:07. While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with these vile hoaxes, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We added another 225,000 jobs last month alone. And that makes seven million jobs since our election, seven million. The unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina. You ever hear of that place?",(21:44),charleston south
Donald Trump,"Now Sleepy Joe would say, “The unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio…” No, no. You’re in South Carolina. Joe! Joe, you’re in South Carolina. Come up. You ever see the guy with the note, “No, no, it’s South Carolina! It’s not Ohio.” Okay. Then he goes, “All right, Iowa. Did you say Iowa?” No. No. They did that seven times. If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right? Be the end of the road. They’d say Trump has lost it. They like to say that anyway, I guess though. These people are bad people. Now, Sleepy Joe. Well, he’s running tomorrow. No, but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes, which are unbelievable? Every speech. I actually said the other night, I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns. I said, “That’s a horrible thing. That’s the end of his evening. That’s the end of his political career.” And then after the debate, they’re revealing him and they said, “Joe Biden had a great night last night.” I don’t get it, Tim. The unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2.3%, the lowest rate in your state’s history. The lowest rate in all of America. It’s the lowest rate in all of America. I said to a friend of mine, a Democrat, “How’s the race going tomorrow? Who’s going to win?” And he says, “Mr. President…” No, it’s very interesting. He said something. This guy’s a real political pro too, in all fairness, even though he’s a Democrat. But I said, “Who’s going to win?” He said, “Honestly, sir, it doesn’t matter. You are so far ahead in South Carolina that it’s meaningless.” Meaningless. That’s what they say. And in North Carolina too. In North Carolina.",(22:56),charleston south

They’ve gone crazy. I mean Nervous Nancy, Crying Chuck Schumer, Crying [inaudible 00:25:57], bunch of losers. The good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates. Whether it’s this character that nobody ever heard of him. I’d never heard it. I thought I knew all the wealthy people. This guy Tom, Mr. Impeachment, how did that work out, Tom Hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa, right? Millions. He got less than 1%.

Everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what we’re supposed to be doing up here. He turned out to be a total catastrophe. 35 million people, can you believe that? That’s a big audience. Very big. And what a killer. But this guy Steyer, he spends all this money. He’s not that wealthy. He spends all of this money and you shouldn’t waste your vote on him tomorrow. I have to be honest. By the way, are the Republicans allowed to vote anyway even though… Are you ready? You ready? Let’s do it together. I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint, I assume.

Who would be the best candidate for us? Not for them. We’re ready. Ready? So let’s go through them just quickly. We won’t include Steyer because he’s a loser. He’s out, okay? We won’t include him. Who would be the best? This is a real poll. This isn’t one of those fake polls taken by … In all fairness, I love you, Fox, taken by Fox, the worst pollster.

So mini Mike, I hear mini Mike, by the way, has left. He’s basically given up. That’s what I hear. He gave up. He gave up. Now, I hope what I just said keeps him in.

That’s what she would … or mini Mike’s plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns. How about that? Mini Mike wants to take away your guns. The insanity of the Democrat party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great new Republican party.

It’s the biggest stadium. And they had 129. I was with the Prime Minister of India, Modi. Great guy, loved by the people of India. And we had an amazing thing. And I went in, and here’s the problem.

But we’ll get their help. One of these days, they’re going to get smart. Senator Scott provides world class care for our veterans. What he’s done for our veterans is incredible. And bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones, including 135 right here in South Carolina. That’s what it is.

My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice. Remember when President Obama would say, “You can keep your doctor. You could keep your plan.” 28 times. He said, “You can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan.” Well, he lied. We should impeach him. We should impeach him for that. He lied 28 times. “You’ll keep your doctor, keep your plan. It’s wonderful. Great.” Went through the roof.

We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. They’re just as good. I always like a name brand.

That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment.

These people are crazy. Trust me, I like what we’re doing and I love this country. I love this country.",(18:04),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Now, and I campaigned on it, at the same time we want to get along with Russia, we want to get along with China, we want to get along with all these countries. Who the hell needs to have conflict? But these people are sick, they are sick people. The radical left’s attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure.",(18:30),las vegas
Donald Trump,"And by the way, you saw today, single best day I’ve ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you, because the real numbers are higher, but any poll they give you as a fake. But Wisconsin, the great state of Wisconsin, I was leading by many, many, many points against every one of these characters. Can you believe it? We got a new one. Mini Mike. How did he do in the debate the other day? Mini Mike. Here’s a box Mike. Here Mike. Mini Mike. He was a beauty.",(18:55),las vegas
Donald Trump,"What happened huh? He couldn’t breathe. What happened? Mike would like to know how about that Pocahontas screaming at him. She forgot. She forgot that she lied about her own heritage. She said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones. That was the only thing. Remember what I said, I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none. Right? I have none. To the best of my knowledge, wouldn’t mind having some, but I happen to have none. And she choked and she went out and got a report done. One, 1 thousandth and 24 you know what that means? That means probably I do have more. Now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him? Why? Because he was gasping for breath. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. She’s hitting me too hard. Pocahontas. Well, she won that debate cause Mike could not respond.",(19:38),las vegas
Crowd,[inaudible 00:00:20:55].,(20:59),las vegas
Donald Trump,"That’s what they all said. They all said that. That’s funny. I won, they’re all shouting. It’s not me that’s saying it. Fake news. You fake news people. No, they all said it though. Who won the debate? Trump. You know what? The way I look at it, when fake news CNN oops, there goes the camera off. Red light just went off. See, I can tell every one of them. I know them by heart. I know the operators. I know the camera men. They’re okay. They’re all on our side by the way. They’re screamed at. Get that camera off. I don’t want to do that. Get that camera off, or it’s going to be you job. All right, I’m sorry. Precedent.",(21:05),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But how bout MSDNC? They’re worse than CNN. And they’re owned by people that really are bad. I think they’re very bad for our country. The owners of Comcast, rotten company, bad for our country, very bad. They try, they have all these PR things to try and keep their image nice and clean. What they do on television is so disgusting. I think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff, right? They can say whatever they want to say. Let’s see what happens over the next period of time. Bunch of dishonest people. Comcast, terrible company. Terrible people running that company. And you know what, I had Celebrity Apprentice, I had the Apprentice on for 14 seasons, 14 seasons, and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass. Please sign. Please. Please sign.",(21:58),las vegas
Donald Trump,"It’s an interesting story. They came and we signed, you know who signed me, Jeff Zucker. It’s one of the only things he’s done good in broadcasting, but I signed and NBC, as you know, is owned by Comcast, but I signed and they figured the show would be a total failure. So they only signed me for one season. You know I was going to have it. It was go on and then the show goes, started at ten went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two. It went to one. I had the number one show in all of television. Number one. It was a phenomenal and the final episode, remember that? With the, you remember that? Do you remember the final? We had, I don’t know, it was one of the biggest shows of the year. It was a tremendous success there.",(23:05),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But here I was, I signed with NBC and they didn’t even want to waste the ink on an option. Usually they have an option for not, you know, just like they didn’t do it. You stupid people. So they paid me very little for the first season I think $25,000 a show, which is considered not good. That’s okay. It was fun. I didn’t know it was going to be success, you know? Hey, just like this was successful. It’s a recent.",(23:58),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Because when I left and Arnold Schwarzenegger and I like Arnold said some very nice things, so I’m not, but the show did not exactly succeed when I left, but I had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and I said, no, I’m going to run for president but I’ll never forget.",(24:27),las vegas
Donald Trump,"I looked at, I didn’t know anything about this business and I had an agent, wonderful guy from William Morris, and he said, sir, I don’t want you to sign. No business show has ever done well on network television. Well, it’s not business, it’s entertainment, celebrity. Sir, I don’t want you to sign. Sir, don’t sign. I said, yeah, okay. But I have a problem. I shook the hand of somebody I have to.",(24:46),las vegas
Donald Trump,"And Mark Burnett was great. He was my guy and but we shook hands. So I have to, but I agreed, you know, I didn’t know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television. So he said, I don’t want you to sign sir, break it. I said, I can’t break it. Can’t break it. Anyway, so the show I said started at ten, went to nine, went to became, it was the number one show all of a sudden, and the agent called me up and he said, sir, I remember it was six in the morning. I was in bed. He said, sir, the show just went to number one. I’d love to see you because I think I’m entitled to more money. I said, you didn’t want me to do the show. Well, not really. I mean, I was okay. He said, I’d really like more money. I said, Jim, I like you very much, Jim, you’re fired. Get out.",(25:11),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Anyway, I had 14 great seasons over about 11 years because it was so successful, they kept… They would have run it. Remember when they did the three hours, the whole night was the Apprentice. I said, wait a minute. Gone With the Wind, to mention the movie a second time, Gone With the Wind is shorter. They had the Apprentice on for three hours. I said even I think it’s too long. You can’t put it up for three. You got leave a little bit like I want to come back next week.",(26:07),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But they had it on for three weeks. We did fantastically with it. Comcast did great. NBC did great. They wanted me to sign for another three years. I said, no, I’m going to for president. And that was actually the time when I knew I was going to run. Because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether you’re rich or not, it’s still a lot of money. I don’t care how rich you are. It’s a lot. Millions and millions of dollars. And I said no, I’m going to run for president. And I did that. But from the day I ran, they went from being, you know one…",(26:33),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But from the day I ran, they went from being wonderful, they were nice. They were nice. I guess if I didn’t do well with the show they wouldn’t have been nice because they weren’t nice to other people that failed. People that didn’t have good ratings, that business is a very simple business. If you have good ratings, you can treat them like garbage. If you have bad ratings, you can say, “Sir, I really respect you so much.”",(27:03),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Get out of here. Get him out of my yard. They’re very ruthless people. But Comcast is a rotten company. They forgot totally. And they are worse than CNN. I will tell you that right now. Comcast is worse than CNN. We should call it Comcast, because that’s their beautiful maiden name, Comcast. They’re worse than CNN.",(27:25),las vegas
Donald Trump,"I’ll, tell you something about CNN. Jake Tapper, today he put out… Now I know you don’t like him. I know. Who likes him? Who the hell can like him? I think his wife likes him. Actually. I really believe she does. But let me just tell you, he put out a couple of social media posts today, because I never call it tweet, I call it social media because it’s much bigger than tweet.",(27:49),las vegas
Donald Trump,"What we have, Dan Scavino. The great Dan Scavino. We have won five sites. We’re number one on Twitter, we’re number one on Facebook, and the whole world. The whole world. So it’s powerful. But Jake Tapper put out some things, basically saying, I believe it, that’s the way I read it, that the new Russian thing that started yesterday, that Putin wants to be sure that Trump, which give me a break. Give me a break. But Jake Tapper said it ain’t so, and if he did say that because they were a little complex, they can turn them around, or when Zucker sees him and said, “Why did you put that? I want that deleted and I want you to do a different one.” But he did say that. So I respect that because it’s another hoax story. But we’re standing up for the defense of our constitution, for our freedom, and democracy itself. You know that.",(28:10),las vegas
Donald Trump,"[inaudible 00:29:03] I got to get that. Hey, Bobby? Bobby? See that guy? I love that shirt. Bobby, I don’t know. He looks like a nice guy.

Donald Trump,"Wow. I just said, “How long have you two been together?” I figured they’d say, “We’re married.” He met her at the rally in Colorado. Can you believe this? Can you believe it? Man, did he get lucky. They both got lucky, right? They both got lucky. Well, that’s cool. No, I just see there’s so much stuff out here. It’s genius, actually. While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with viral hoaxes, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. As you heard, we added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Way above anticipated schedule. And that makes 7 million new jobs since the election. The number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million. And remember, if I give you wrong numbers, the fake news is going to have headlines.",(31:13),las vegas
Donald Trump,"“Trump gave you wrong…” I mean, it’s very tough. I’ve got to be very careful. Even if I give you wrong in the wrong way, they’ll say it was wrong. I said, “Yeah, but it was wrong in the low way.” No, that’s no good either. Got to be very precise with these characters. The Democrats don’t have to be, but we have to be. We’ve destroyed he ISIS territorial caliphate 100%, we killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al Baghdadi is dead. Al Baghdadi is dead. 17 years. They looked for him. 17 years.",(32:28),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Al-Baghdadi. One of the first things I did when I came in. He’s the founder of ISIS and when I came in three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. And I said, “You got to knock it out.” We knocked it out of Syria, and, Iraq and other places. We really knocked at 100%.",(33:17),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Remember I wanted to leave. I said, “All right.” We were at 96%, then 98, then 99%. I said, “Let some of these other countries do it.” Wouldn’t you say, right? So what happened is I wanted to leave and they said, “No, no, no, we want 100%.” So we wait and stayed. We got 100%, then we moved them all out of Syria, except we did keep the oil. You noticed that, right? We kept the oil. Sorry. They said, “He left soldiers in Syria.” Yeah, I did to keep the oil, if you don’t mind. Which is what we should have done in Iraq too, by the way.",(33:35),las vegas
Donald Trump,"I would have done that. I’m making a lot of money with all that oil. But you remember that whole thing, that whole… I said, “You got to find Al Baghdadi.” I’ve been saying that actually for two years. I had a lot of other things to do the first year, like fight off the Democrats. These crazy Democrats with their hoaxes. Think of it.",(34:07),las vegas
Donald Trump,"If they use their genius, because they are genius at that stuff, right? They’re really good. They can take nothing. They can take a perfect phone call made to the Ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure. He doesn’t even know what’s going on and they can take this perfect call. Thank goodness I had a transcriber. Do you agree with it? Because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was.",(34:30),las vegas
Donald Trump,"So when I released the call, when I released the transcripts, they died. They said, “Oh we got a problem.” They never thought I was going to do it, but I had no choice. I had to because I had to show they’re liars. But think of it, they can take something like that, a perfect phone call, or they’ll take just out of thin air they can make something up.",(34:59),las vegas
Donald Trump,"And they ended up today, front page, New York Times. They used to call it the eighth column. That’s the big column on the right. I don’t know. The papers become so small. I don’t know if they have an eighth column anymore. They used to have the eighth column, was a big deal, right? That was the big deal. Today it’s too narrow. Think they’re probably… After I’m gone, they won’t have any columns. That’s why eventually they’re going to support me.",(35:19),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Eventually, the Times and the Washington post, which will be dead as a doornail after I leave, and the CNN, it’ll be an obsolete business, the cable business. MSDNC will be out of business. You know, cable was supposed to be obsolete and now they’re doing the highest numbers they’ve ever done. If an airplane goes down with 700 people, they don’t cover it. If it’s not Trump related, they don’t cover it. It’s got to be Trump or Trump related. So if a plane goes down and it’s total devastation, if the ship goes down, if the Titanic-",(35:42),las vegas

Speaker 5,Titanic.,(36:33),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But you know what they’re going to do before the election? They’re going to say, “We want to just say something. We’re going to endorse the president.” You know why? Because they’ll be out of business. Can you imagine if they had to cover mini Mike? Who I don’t think, I think he’s gone, but you know what? He’ll spend another 500 million. Don’t forget I spent 70 and I won, of my money. In other words, they said, and this was in the New York Times, I said the other night in Colorado.",(36:35),las vegas
Donald Trump,"I spent 70, mini Mike so far has spent almost $500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by Pocahontas. Pocahontas. And she’s mean, isn’t she? Did you see that? Do you see the anger on her face? That nervous energy. She’s jumping up and down. She’s a mess. But no, no, she’s mean. Right? Right? That face is just… “You want to get him?” She said, “I got him. I want to see those agreements.” “I,” “You open up those agreements.” This poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each one’s a disaster. He said, “I don’t want to open those agreements. Nobody told me this was going to happen.”",(37:04),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Said, “Actually, sir.” “Nobody told me. Get me out of here.” After the debate, he went backstage, fired a lot of people. He said, “How the hell did you get me into this thing?” But Pocahontas was really mean, but she’s going to be easy. I hope it’s her. It’s not going to be her.",(37:53),las vegas
Donald Trump,"She made a little comeback the other night because she took mini Mike to the cleaners. But it’s not going to be here. It can’t be [inaudible 00:11:28]. Can’t be, I don’t think.

Donald Trump,"They all said… No. Howdy Doody. See nobody knows who Alfred E. Neuman is. Only the real aficionados. They’re the ones and they love it. But that’s only 15% of the crowd, right? Am I right? Better than Howdy Doody. Howdy Doody.",(38:46),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But he’s got to learn. He’s got to worry about his own city. It’s going to hell, so he’s got to worry. Because that city’s got a lot of problems. I don’t get the whole thing, but he’s not a bad debater, I will say. He’s probably the best up there. And Bernie is too emotional. He’s screaming, going crazy. And Biden is angry. Biden is angry. Everything’s anger. [inaudible 00:39:26] And that’s what happens when you can’t get the words out. No it does.",(39:02),las vegas
Donald Trump,"That’s what happens, right? When you can’t get the words out, you get angry. You get angry because you can’t get the words. That might happen to me someday. Can you imagine if that happened to me? Man, would I be a bad guy. I’d be the meanest man in history. No, but Biden is very angry.",(39:35),las vegas
Donald Trump,"He gets angrier, and angrier, and angrier. He’s changed. And then you have the Tom. Yeah. He said Tom Steyer. Tom said, ” Mister impeachment.” How did that work out, Tom? Thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing.",(39:52),las vegas
Donald Trump,"How did that work out? This schmuck spends $250 million dollars, he ends up with one third of a percent in Iowa.

All I know, it said 1% and an arrow left.",(40:09),las vegas

This guy, this phony is a big environmentalist. He made his money, a lot of it, in the coal business. Nobody knows that, but he’s a fake.",(40:31),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Remember when he walked up to Bernie the other day. “Hi Bernie. Hi.” Oh, and he was having a fight with Pocahontas, right? Is this the greatest? Mark Burnett said, “This is the greatest reality show in history.” He said, “You can take The Apprentice, and you can take Survivor, and you can take every other reality show ever made, multiply it times 10,000, and you still don’t have what we have. And even the CAS.” He did say this. You got the perfect president. You got the perfect first lady. How about the first lady? You got the perfect kids. The kids, though. Those beautiful kids. My beautiful kids. They had such a great life, before I did this. Sorry, kids. Sorry. My beautiful Ivanka. She had such a great life.

I want to come to Washington and help people get jobs.”",(40:48),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Right? Ain’t that true? And she left the company. And when you leave a company, all of a sudden it doesn’t do as well. I wouldn’t say that I exactly helped talking about the wall and other things, but she left the company, came to Washington and she said 500,000 jobs. That was her goal. And she did that in the first month. She actually did.",(42:02),las vegas

She’s now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies. It’s incredible. 15 million. And she’s smart. She got it figured out, but most people can’t, but she does.

Donald Trump,"I deal with all these big companies and these great, great countries. I think I could get my sons 25 board chips for millions of dollars a piece. My kids would be [inaudible 00:43:21]. But you know what? We don’t do any of that stuff. We don’t do that stuff. We don’t do it. The kid got $3 million dollars, 83,000 a month and he didn’t have a job until his father became vice president. And speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television, because it’s the greatest show of all time, right? Look at us. Look.",(43:10),las vegas
Donald Trump,"We told you, what, last night? Little change here, folks. We’re going to move it up from eight o’clock in the evening until 12 o’clock in the afternoon. Little change. Just a minor change. Because I have to get back to Washington to work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun. But speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents, if you become president, the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible, horrible vice president. So if the idiots ever want to impeach you, they have to say, I can’t impeach him. Look who we have. I have the perfect vice president. I have the greatest in the world. I have the greatest vice president.",(43:48),las vegas

I call it the billboard. It’s a billboard. So let’s go just that. Because I am very surprised by it. We’re going to keep them both, but I just curious if we did go to one, “Make America great again?” ” Keep America great?”",(50:29),las vegas
Donald Trump,"I can’t. I would have said that’s impossible. “Make America great again,” is the greatest phrase. A lot of people, again, fake news, I think will agree to it. It’s the greatest phrase ever used in politics. It’s the greatest phrase. Now, who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say, “Oh, let’s go with a new phrase.” Right?",(51:03),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But we’re going to keep it. So we have to keep MAGA. But now we have CAG, now we have CAG. So we have a both. I just don’t have the courage to get rid of the one. It would be too disrespectful. Too disrespectful. But Michael McDonald, I want to thank you and the members of the Nevada Republican central committee. You’re all here. They’re great people. And the man came here. He loves us. He’s been with us. Rick Harrison of the world famous gold and silver pawn shop. Rick Harrison.",(51:40),las vegas
Donald Trump,"You better win, Michael. Otherwise, that’s the last time I’m introducing you like that. I hear we’re up. I hear we’re doing nicely. I hear we’re doing great. And by the way, the union, I have a lot of respect for that union. Last time, I had a strike in my building during the election. It’s the only reason we would have won this state. Brilliantly to save three cents. I could have settled the strike before the election. I wanted to save $2 total.",(52:22),las vegas
Donald Trump,"That was a brilliant move. And then we had some guy running. A guy named [inaudible 00:25:55]. And he wasn’t too good. He didn’t do too good. But we almost won this state despite… I had a big strike. Had thousands and thousands of union guys. They had it, look, they wanted, wanted to show us. But I think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us. They’re Teamsters, so many of the unions.",(52:49),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Because I’m for the working man and woman, whether you’re union or non-union. Some States are all union, some states are no union. But we get them all.

The unions have worked hard on healthcare and they’re going to ruin them.",(53:16),las vegas
Donald Trump,"They’re going to take away… Well, we’re going to… you can lose 180 million people off of great private healthcare. So we’ll see what happens. But a lot of the Democrats want to do that. They think it’s wonderful. But together we’re building the world’s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society. That’s true. Since my election, over 125-",(53:38),las vegas
Donald Trump,"That’s true. Since my election, over 125,000 new jobs have been created right here in Nevada, including over 40,000 new Nevada manufacturing and construction jobs. A 30% increase. The national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century, and soon we’re going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others. The average unemployment rate for my administration, this is the coolest of them all, is the lowest for any United States president in recorded history. That’s pretty good. When I’m in a debate, they’re saying, “we’re going to do this.” I say, “listen, we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country.” African American unemployment, Hispanic American. Hispanic, we got a lot of Hispanic. I love Hispanic. Who in this audience is Hispanic? Yeah, we’re doing great. Well, we should be doing great. You have the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded. Asian Americans, likewise the lowest ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low. People I love, people I might’ve helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability. The veteran’s unemployment rate drop to the lowest record. Lowest in history.",(54:02),las vegas
Donald Trump,"The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember they’re back there checking every word. They’re going,” oh, my god. He’s right.” I can’t say it because I got all these maniacs back there. They’re trying to find… “He put the comma in the wrong place. He didn’t make that word plural, therefore he lied.” Now I’ve got to be very accurate because all these numbers, they check them out. “They’re in there, checking them out. Check on the African American unemployment, please.” Please tell me it’s not historic. These people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth. Not all of them. Workers without a high school diploma. We have millions of people that didn’t go through high school. They left. They had problems, good problems, bad problems, families where they don’t have the money. They didn’t get a high school diploma. They’ve achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the United States.",(56:02),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Those are important groups of people. Half a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home. Now, Hispanic have done so good. And by the way, you know who understands the border, because we are building that wall like crazy. Remember, they also said, “if you build the wall you’ll lose the Hispanic vote.” I said, “I got to do what’s right. You know who understands the border better than anybody? You know who understands crime at the border better than anybody? The Hispanics understand it and they don’t want to be working and have people come and take their job. Have people come in where they can’t pay for their house, have people come in who are very bad people.” You have some very bad people. You have murderers and rapists, and we have set all sorts of records at the border, but we’re up to 122 miles of wall, and it is true. The people that understand it the best are Hispanic. So, thank you. We got to make our country safe. We’ve lifted 10 million people off of welfare. Median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country. Think of that. I say it all the time. President Bush, eight years, $450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, $ 975. President Donald John Trump, three years. It’s actually less when they did the numbers. Three years, including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts. Three years.",(57:14),las vegas
Donald Trump,"So, you had 450, 975, that’s eight and eight. Now we’re down to three years, a little less, three years, $ 10,000 per family a year. 10,000 a year. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats. I deal with them. They’re not good. It’s called the swamp. We’ve ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, reducing your prices. Part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric. I also recently took action on an issue Nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years. Yucca mountain. You know Yucca mountain? My budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at Yucca mountain, so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives. Why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard? I won’t say which countries, but you know what other countries do? I will not say which ones.",(59:22),las vegas
Donald Trump,"They put it on a ship. They float it out into the middle of the ocean. They find a nice deep spot and they dump it. That’s the end of it. But we would never do that for environmental reasons. We are reversing decades so Yucca mountain… You’re okay, please. Okay. Just relax. Sheldon, do you have somebody at your newspaper back there who can write. Yucca mountain, please. He’ll call up, “Yucca mountain is okay.” That’s the end of that. So Yucca mountain, you’re in great shape. Maybe they can finally report it properly, but we’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth. They stole our wealth. They shipped it overseas and to other countries. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO, the world trade organization. Probably an even worse deal for us than NAFTA, if that’s possible, but under my administration, the great betrayal of America is over. America is no longer for sale. Last month we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement USMCA. See, we played the song YMCA because that’s the only way you’ll remember. Just think of the song YMCA. Think of the song and you’ll remember that USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Nevada. I also took the strongest ever action to confront China’s massive theft of America jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a ground breaking trade agreement. Probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property and boost American exports by a lot. China will be buying $250 billion worth of goods from us now and 50 billion from our farmers. My guys wanted 16, I said, “make it 50.” My guys wanted 16, they got China up to 20. I said, “Nope. Got to make it 50,” and then I said to China, “you got a billion and a half people. What difference does it make?” They said, “you’re right.” 50 billion, I don’t think our farmers can produce that much, but we’re going to soon find out. They’re going to buy very large tractors. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. we are finally putting America first.",(01:00:49),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Before I came into office, the far left’s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children, including right here in a very big way. The great state of Nevada. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. You know that, you’ve been complaining about it for a long time. It’s one of the reasons you voted for Trump. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, of healthcare, of lots of other things, including education. All paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. Illegal immigration costs Nevada taxpayers, think of it, more than $1.6 billion every year, over $1,500 per household. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild every city, all of these distressed areas in the United States, throughout our country. The money spend, it’s not even thinkable and don’t forget when we say come, like in California the clown, he says, “come, we’ll give you free healthcare.” People that weren’t even thinking about coming. That’s why we have caravans of people that we’re turning back. Mexico’s been great. By the way, they gave us 27,000 soldiers on our border.",(01:04:26),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But when a governor, nice guy actually, he’s a nice guy. We just got to explain the facts of life. He’s a nice guy. Oh doctor, please. Doctor in the house, please. Medical, please. A doctor. Thank you. Take your time. We’ve got plenty of time. Yeah, take your time please. A lot of these people have been here for three days. It’s a lot. Those front row people are tough. Take your time, doc. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, doctor. That’s true. They get here so… They stand and sit and sometimes days early. In Colorado, they’re there three, four days early. It’s tough. And we work it and make sure that you have everything you want. Number one, we cover the facts and number two, we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time. But things like that happen a lot because after two, three days, it’s not easy and these are strong people. I’m not going to fight any of them, okay?",(01:06:16),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Now, amazing people. Thank you very much. Under my administration, we’re finally taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of illegal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, lift up our society, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities. Every day, Democrats’ open border policies are harming and killing innocent people. You know what’s happening, you know what’s going on. In this region alone last year, ICE officers, and they’re patriots. They’re strong, tough patriots. If we didn’t have them. They remove thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members a year and plenty of others. Who else is going to do it? ICE officers arrested over 5, 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape, and even murder. Many murders. In Western Nevada, an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year. Right here in Las Vegas, three MS13 gang members abducted a man, tied him up with his shoelaces, shot him repeatedly, and hacked him to death with a machete. You know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s right here in your place, in Las Vegas, right here. Tied up and hacked him to death. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals and murderers, and they support deadly sanctuary cities. I say this all the time and I just… How the hell, where are they coming from? I don’t get it right. Seriously, I don’t get it. Sanctuary cities imperil American lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020. And you have some great ones here, Michael. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. And as the wall gets longer, it gets easier and easier. Remember when the Democrats were saying, “you don’t need a wall.” Two things that never change, right? All these computers, they said, “use drones.” Oh great, we’ll fly over with drones. Watch the people pour in by the thousands. That’s great. Use drones. Before I came along, they all wanted a wall. They just didn’t know how to build it. They had no clue. They had the money, they actually gave the money back, but they had no clue. But as soon as I came in and I said, “Wall,” they went against and I made a terrible mistake.",(01:10:05),las vegas
Donald Trump,"They always say I never admit mistakes. I do, but I’ll admit a mistake now. I should have said, we will never, ever under any circumstances build a wall. They would have given me so much money for a wall, you have no idea. They would’ve forced me to build it. I made a terrible mistake, right? Terrible mistake. If it ever happens again, which it won’t. This wall is one of a kind. They will say, “we will not build a wall,” and they’ll say, “we demand that you build a wall,” and it would have been so easy. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring and we have ended catch and release. A horrible [inaudible 00:01:14:08].",(01:13:22),las vegas
Donald Trump,"We catch them. You know the story. They come over, could be a killer, murderer, rapist. They come over. We can’t do anything. We have to be politically correct. We catch them. We then say, “what’s your address?” They don’t know. They don’t even know their country in many cases. Where do you come from? We don’t know and they mean it, but some are very serious criminals. So, we catch them, we take whatever they can take, which is nothing, and then we had to release them in our country. We can’t bring them back. And then we have a system of judges, thousands of judges all over the place. You got to be like Perry Mason and every illegal that comes in, they have the lawyers. The lawyers meet them, they get paid fees, but we’re breaking the system. No more catch and release, you think that was easy? And the big thing is that 30 foot… And this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol. Totally. And border patrol has seized the largest amount, just recently, of deadly narcotics ever recorded. The largest amount. We’ve deported record numbers of gang members. We’ve done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We are, as I said, building the wall faster than ever. Faster and bigger than anyone thought possible. They can’t believe we’re getting it done. We’ll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year. 500 miles.",(01:14:06),las vegas
Donald Trump,"Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. 132 congressional Democrats have now signed up for Bernie Sanders takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans, many of them in this room, of their private coverage.

We’ll do a belated impeachment. 28 times, “you can keep your doctor,” right? Remember, you could keep your doctor. Unfortunately, when they found out you can’t keep your doctor, he said, “I was just kidding.” Now, we should impeach him. We’ll do a belated impeachment. Fake news, you have it. See, you have to be very careful when you say impeachment because you know what they do? They go back and they write. President Trump said that Obama should be impeached, but he’s not in office and so therefore they can’t impeach. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about because he’s not in office, so therefore they can’t. So, you have to be very careful. That’s why I use the word belated impeachment. Belated, meaning I’m just kidding, okay?",(01:15:55),las vegas
Donald Trump,"They do it all the time. They had it the other day. I said, “bring back Gone With The Wind,” right? I said a little bit up here, but I said the movie the other day in Colorado, I guess. I said, “Huh, South Korean movie won.” They said, “ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Academy Award is …” A movie made in South Korea, what’s this all about? And I deal with them, they like me.

But now, anybody sitting there reading this saying, “man, Trump, can’t be that smart. He said bring back Gone With the Wind. That’s an old movie.” Yeah, it’s an old classic.

I told somebody, the evening newscasts, they’re terrible for conservative people and they’re crooked, they’re absolutely dishonest. I said to one of the big broadcasters, I’m friendly with him. I said, “if you ever did a conservative newscasts, instead of… you got, ABC is terrible. NBC is just absolutely atrocious.” And they do badly. Not a lot of people are watching. They used to, when we had the late, great Walter Cronkite and these legends, right? But ABC is terrible and NBC is terrible and CBS is terrible. They’re all the same. And I said, “your ratings stink.

Their ratings would go through the roof, but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times. They would rather have a fail… Seven months ago we had a little skit, and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money, or big parts of it, and have a really horrible market on the basis that we, not me, we could not be elected on November 3rd.

If you go to a hospital, they won’t even tell you how much it’s going to cost. They operate and then they’ll give you a bill and you’ll say, “Oh my god, I had no idea it could be.” They take blood. We have one person, blood $39. Another place, the exact same thing, $2500. Take blood, a blood test. One is $39 one, is $2500. The same test. Maybe the $39 test is better. Who the hell knows? But it’s crazy. Price transparency and he looks at me. He goes, and he’s a real pro. One of the top in the country. He said, “Sir,” and nobody wanted to do it because it’s a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don’t exactly love it. The hospitals don’t love it, but I got to do what’s right for you. The people, I don’t care, I’m not. I got to do it.",(01:30:45),las vegas

He said, “Sir, price transparency is bigger than healthcare.” I said, “What do you mean by that?” He said, “You will see numbers that far outweigh healthcare, hospitals, doctors.” He said, “You’ll be able to price out everything. You’ll be able to see costs.” He said, “Price transparency.” You know, people you’ve heard about this for 15, 20 years. No president has the guts to do it.

So think of it, we’re going to win.",(01:32:24),las vegas
Donald Trump,"But let’s say the fake news could give me enough phony stories, enough bad stuff that we don’t make it.

And then the guy comes along said, “I want to make 20 forms of aspirin.” They’re exactly the same. Exactly. But they don’t have a big name on it. Exactly as good. I don’t say better. I don’t say worse. They’re exactly the same. You know, people still, they want to go out and buy the name. You know? I do. I do. You know? Because it’s just because we’re stupid. No, it’s true.

How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn’t breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, “Are you accusing me of being dumb?” Who would make a statement like that? Because that’s really what he was doing, but he doesn’t want to say that. No, how about that? “Are you saying I’m dumb?” That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don’t say that. Even if it’s true, you don’t say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn’t treat us the way they used to.

The great Lou Dobbs. And you’ve got Hegseth and you’ve got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right?

Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn’t like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, “Donald Trump didn’t do well in the debates and he won,” because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, “Wait a minute, I won every debate.” It’s true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I’m just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, “Nobody’s allowed to do that.

It’s like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it’s successful again. But when we leave, it’s all of us. We leave together. We’re unified.

He said, “You’re number one in the world in Facebook.” I said, “That’s nice.” I said, “Who’s number two?” He said, “Prime minister Modi of India.” I said, “Wait a minute, wait a minute. He’s got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.” But we’re never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven’t figured it out.

Can we get Gone with the Wind back, please? Sunset Boulevard. So many great movies. The winner is from South Korea. I thought it was best foreign film, right? Best foreign movie.

He didn’t do well in the polls.” She said, “He didn’t do well on the debates.” She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she’s crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, “Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?” 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn’t get in trouble.

Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I’m the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling… And the people get it. But she said I didn’t do well on the bench. I said, “Really? I won every single debate.” We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here’s one.

Here’s a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn’t do well in the debate.

And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that’s dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don’t have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren’t fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get.

Donald Trump,"We’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It’s over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state.",(01:05:07),colorado springs
Donald Trump,"Also, something we got that people don’t talk about, if you love your children, you don’t have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it’s great, and if you don’t love your children, don’t worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don’t love them, don’t leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don’t treat you well, give don’t leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took … no, it is true. That’s a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their … people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn’t do it. They’d go out … your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They’d end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they’re good kids, and maybe they’ll never be you. They can’t farm like you and maybe they can’t any maybe they can, maybe they’re better. But you know what?

We’re talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn’t pay for it despite the fact that these guys … they like to say they did, we didn’t pay for it, and I’ll tell you what.

Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he’s done a great job. I said, “Who’s the most? What’s the biggest year?” “$16 billion, sir.” I said, “All right, make it 20.” So they agreed on 20 so now we’re getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We’re getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We’re getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, “What do you have down for the farmers? They’ve been great,” although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it.",(01:08:33),colorado springs

I said, “Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.” So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, “Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?” “No, no, no, no, no,” and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it.",(01:09:24),colorado springs

I said, “Our farmers will find a way. They’ll go out and buy larger tractors and they’ll buy some extra land.” Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I’ve had people say, “Sir, they can’t produce that much.” I said, “Forget it.” They will. Look at them. You’re a farmer. They’ll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you’ll never figure it out. They’ll figure it out long before him. You’ll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers.

They weren’t taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don’t even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don’t want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don’t want to take chances either, but we’ll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn’t use to take them. They said, “We don’t want them back.

The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we’re watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals.",(01:11:57),colorado springs
Donald Trump,"As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party.

You say, “Where do you live?” They don’t live here. They don’t have an address. “Where do you live? Give us your address.” They don’t have an address. Many are criminals.

Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they’re pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it’s Mexico, it’s very rough territory, some of it. It’s partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn’t put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump’s wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It’s true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it’s set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine?",(01:15:52),colorado springs

We’re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That’s going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way.

Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything. They want to give them everything. For a long period of time, they were treated… You know this before I came. They were treated far better than our veterans were treated. Now our veterans are treated great.

They want to protect them.",(51:04),phoenix arizona

That’s okay.” I said, “That’s okay.” No, I said, “That’s okay,” because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd. But you know what? Honestly, there’s tremendous energy in our nation.

And what we’ve done, we’ve gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you. Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice. We’re making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and it’s better healthcare. A lot of people don’t know this. People don’t know this. They think that’s their issue. It’s not. They failed on healthcare. We’re protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will. And by the way, we’re trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we’re managing it incredibly, but we’re trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions. Remember that. We’re trying to get rid of it, but while we’re having it, we’re managing it really much better than they did. Remember they built the $5 billion website? Remember that? It was supposed to cost $5 million. It cost $5 billion. $5 billion. I mean, you could get a kid out of high school.",(56:21),phoenix arizona

The kids, they make us look like babies with that. But he could have given you a great site for about $2. They spent $5 billion on a site that never worked.

I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don’t know what the hell they’re doing. I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see … And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa. We had more votes than anybody’s ever had as an incumbent president.

Nobody liked me. And then we won. Thank you, women. Nobody liked me 2016. No, no, I hear that. Remember, women didn’t like him, and at the end of that he did great with women. He did great with this. He did great with everybody. We did great with everybody. Remember, 306 to 223. That’s a slaughter. That’s a slaughter. Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path.

That’s right, Doug.

It’s a much better story if I use it because that’s the truth. That’s what they said. “How did you vote?” Usually, they say, “I voted for Clinton,” or, “I voted for Trump.” Right? “How’d you vote?” “None of your business.” See, I’m being nice, right? I’ll keep it that way because otherwise we’ll ruin the whole evening. They’ll say, “His language,” right? Even this tough guy in the front says, “I agree.” “How did you vote?” “No, I don’t want to tell you.” “How did you vote?” “None of your damn business. I’m not going to tell you.” “How did you vote?” “I’m not … ”",(01:01:24),phoenix arizona

So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing. She hated Donald Trump, but they said, “What the hell does she stand for? What does she do?” Every ad was a negative ad. So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren’t so good. They can be effective. But I think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads. Everything was negative. So nobody knew what the hell she spent.",(01:03:23),phoenix arizona

You better go to Wisconsin.” She said, “No, we haven’t lost Wisconsin in 36 years”. “No, no, Hillary, you got to go there. I’m telling you, I don’t like what I saw.” “No, what do you know?” He’s a professional politician. She wasn’t. It’s one of those little problems in life.

Why don’t they call it?” It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they’re crooked. They are fake.

Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, “Well, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio.” And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now we’re up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why? We’re bringing back jobs. We’re bringing back factories. Everybody’s working. Nobody’s ever had a better year than we’ve been having. And we’ve been doing it for a long time, right? Almost from the beginning.",(01:04:54),phoenix arizona

We freed up our nation to go back to work. True.",(01:05:57),phoenix arizona

The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin’s doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking. You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products. Okay? So what happens is this, we’re working on healthcare. We’re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. We’ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. We’ve totally transformed veteran’s healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if you’re in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena’s in trouble, but if you’re in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. It’s incredible what’s happening. People would go to Europe. They’d go to Asia. If they had no money, they’d go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before they’re approved. Think of that. Before they’re approved. And we’re very importantly combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths.

All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right?

We are the party with big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right? Right? To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life. There’s been nothing like this. I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats.

Donald Trump,"The fact is, America is respected again. It’s been a long time. But as we keep on winning, Washington democrats keep on losing their minds. They’re crazy. That’s why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They’re joining our great Republican party. Now, I can’t tell you what’s happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here, right? Remember last time? We won the primary tremendously. We should have won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses. And it was very, very close even though they did, but this year we have a great governor, Governor Sununu. Great governor, Chris. And now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it should be a lot different. But we have done great. This has been an incredible state for us. It’s a state where the people are great, just great people. And we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries, don’t you? So I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats. Does that make sense? You people wouldn’t do that. My only problem is I’m trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate? I think they’re all weak if you want to know the truth.",(10:23),new hampshire

And to me, I view it differently. Well, look at your 401ks. I mean, who is doing well with their 401k? Up 90%. Up 104%. Is there anybody doing badly with the 401k? I’d like to not talk to that person. Does anybody have a 401k where they’re doing badly, please? Oh, don’t put up your hand. I don’t believe it.",(12:06),new hampshire

She thinks I am the worst person with money, with financial. She thinks I’m just horrible. In the last three years, I’m up 94%, sir. She thinks I’m a total genius when it comes to finance.

I don’t think we have to worry too much about it, but that’s okay… And very highly respected, Senators Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul. Great guys. Warriors, they’re warriors. Hey, Lindsay and Rand. That’s not bad. Can you imagine if you actually came from New Hampshire what it would be? Right? That’s not bad, but they have been great. All they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said, “Read the transcripts please. Read the transcripts.” But I want to thank you both very much.

His wife was devastated. His family was devastated. The doctor told me he didn’t have a good chance, but he’s tough as hell and he’s a really terrific friend. He’s a winner.

The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. You believe that one? That’s pretty amazing. That’s pretty amazing.

They build a windmill within distance of your house. You could forget about your house. You could just say, well, that was the end of that investment. You want to see a bird graveyard, go to the bottom of a windmill. Take a look. It’s a graveyard for birds. They kill all the birds.

Rough, rough stuff, but I think it’s going to work out good. We only have 11 cases and they’re all getting better.

On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than a thing called immigration, right? Before I came into office, the far left’s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that’s what they want. I see them campaigning right down the street. It’s really boring to watch, but I try and watch. No, I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff. But they want open borders. They want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom are not exactly what we’re looking for, okay? I mean murderers, rapists, and some other things. They’re going to be poisoning our children with drugs, including right here in New Hampshire, and you have one of the drug problems in the country. And we brought it down 18% but we have to do better. 18%. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone into our country from all around the world. Just come on in, folks, we’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to give you free education. We’re going to give you more than our vets are getting. Every family will get a free Rolls Royce. You know I said that, Matt. I said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said, “President Trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free Rolls Royce. He lied. He lied. He lied.” They gave me a Pinocchio. They don’t get it, Matt, do they, Matt? Actually they get it better than we understand. They get it very well. They get it. They know what’s happening. And the wall is being built. I will tell you the wall is being built. And you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up. So what’s happening? You do know who’s paying for the wall, don’t you? Right. Redemption from illegal aliens that are coming. The redemption money is paying for the wall. They’re so sad to hear that because it’s okay, finally, they go. You have to understand an entire party is fighting. They’ll give me anything I want. Our military would rebuilt it. 2.2, it’s really $2.5 trillion over a period of three years. They give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall. They said, “We like drones.” Well, drones don’t keep people out. Drones are wonderful. They fly around, take pictures. We’re going to give you a drone. No good.

You wouldn’t believe it. You have to see what happens when that wall goes up. You have to see the numbers change like magic. They change like magic.

They’re never going to replace the wheel and they’re never going to replace the wall, and it’s a high wall.

And I haven’t done it for a while, and I thought I’d do it tonight because you’re on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders. They want open borders, and we don’t want open borders. We want very strong closed borders.

One of guests at the State of the Union was American citizen, Jody Jones. I introduced him that night.

He’s on top of it. He’s on top of it. And his father is a great guy. His father didn’t like me too much a few years ago. Once I won, I’m telling you, he was so good. He was as good.

They don’t have addresses. What’s your address? What? They don’t have addresses. They come into the country, they don’t have addresses. So you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say, “We’ll see you in four years for your court case.” We never see them. They never come back.

That’s bringing prices down. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan. Remember President Obama, you could keep your plan. You could keep 28 times.

I went and I saw Ambassador Lighthizer’s in charge, he’s fantastic. I said, “What are you doing? We’re getting ready for the final deal. What are you doing?” He said, “I’m putting in $20 billion.” Because I asked Sonny Perdue. He’s great. You know who he is, right? Secretary of Agriculture. I said, “Sonny, what’s the biggest number that China’s ever done with the farmers?” He said, “Sir, $16 billion last year. $16 billion.” This was two years ago.

We have to be very careful.",(08:10),iowa rally

They’re negotiators. They targeted Trump states. Where do they love Trump? They love him in Iowa. They love him in Nebraska. They love him in all these states. They love him in Wisconsin. They love him. We won Wisconsin. They like him and Wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted. The farmers came to see me and they said, “Sir, you have to do what’s right.” When the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, “No, no, President Trump is doing the right thing. It should have been done years ago. Should’ve been done years and years ago.” But you couldn’t have made it because there was too much money, $16 billion. So, what I did is I put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from China, $250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the $250 billion market. We took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. We still are, and then what happened? When I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers, they were in the White House. They came to see me. I had 36 farmers and I said, “I’m going to give you.” They said, “Sir, we don’t want anything.” I said, “What do you mean you don’t want anything? I’ve never heard that before.” Everybody wants money. They want every. They said, “We just want a level playing field.” I never forgot it. They said, “We don’t want anything. We just want a level playing field, and we’ve been treated badly for years, for years.”",(08:42),iowa rally

We’re going to give you the levelest field that you ever had. But, but in the meantime, I’m going to give you $12 billion, out of these tens of billions that we’re collecting.” Don’t worry. We had plenty of left over, because we never got 25 cents from China. China took from us. We didn’t take from China, right? I said, “I’m going to give you $12 billion for the year before, and I’m going to give you $16 billion for this year.” That was last year for this year. So, they got, meaning you, a lot of you in this audience, got $12 billion, and you got 16, so you got $28 billion over that short period of time, and you were able to actually, in some cases, I guess thrive. I told Sonny, “I want to take care of the small farmer too, not just the big monsters. I want to take care of everyone, everyone.”",(10:24),iowa rally

They’d go into diners. “What do you think about Trump? Isn’t it a terrible what he’s doing with the trade?” The farmer would say, “No, he’s doing what should have been done 20 years ago.” Now, you people are going to make so much money. You’re not going to do just, you know what? Just relax. Take it easy. Put it away. Enjoy your life. But you’re going to make a lot of money. You’re going to make a lot of money.

He loved roadside bombs. When you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries, frankly, walking around, they don’t have legs, they don’t have arms in some cases. Some cases they don’t have both. You see them walking around, or riding around, or the most brave people, these people have the greatest attitude.

Nobody’s ever cut regulations. That’s why all these jobs are being built. Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost $10,000, and that’s three years, and it’s going up. It’s going up very substantial. That’s a big difference.",(22:57),new jersey
Donald Trump,"New business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high, and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare. They’re off. They are off federal welfare. Nobody would’ve believed these numbers. Someday they’re going to write the true story. Our child tax credit alone is delivering $2,200 a year to 40 million American families. We have ended, so importantly for you, the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We don’t need anybody else’s energy anymore. It’s so nice. What happened in the last three years with energy is incredible, but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down U.S. energy, including through the so-called Green New Deal.",(24:37),new jersey
Donald Trump,"Close your factories. Get rid of your cows. You don’t have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, they’re gone. We will never sacrifice America’s energy independence. Took us a long time to get there, and we really picked it up over the last three years. What we’ve done is incredible, pipelines all over. Pipelines are good. They’re underground, they’re good, environmentally sound. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most. These are the communities that really have suffered. We created, with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina, You know who I’m talking about? Tim Scott, right? Senator Tim Scott, he’s an incredible guy. He really is. He came to my office and he had this idea that he’s wanted to do for a long time. Senator Tim Scott, opportunity zones, and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey, all over the United States. Billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and not government dollars, they’re flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead.",(25:52),new jersey
Donald Trump,"For decades, politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers, but then they went to Washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash, and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries. They closed up your factories. They got rid of your jobs. They didn’t have to pay taxes. Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steal our farms and ransack our communities. Not anymore, not anymore, because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a President who puts America first. Is that okay?",(27:14),new jersey
Donald Trump,"The United States laws, listen to this number, and you know if it was wrong, the fake news would be all over me, and I’ve been saying it for three years. The United States lost 60,000 factories and plants. Think of that. You wouldn’t think that’s possible because of stupid trade deals, because of bad leadership. During the 16 years of the two prior administrations, under just three years, my administration has now added 12,000 new factories, and many more are being built and they’re pouring back into the United States, because that’s where the action is. That’s where they want to be. They are pouring back into our country, new plants and factories. You see them all over. I passed two of them coming in, brand new, beautiful plants and factories. They’re pouring back in. This is where the action is. This is where they want to be. I see the leaders, they say, “It’s incredible what happened to your country.” I said, “Don’t tell me that. We want you to have your companies build plants in New Jersey and other places,” and that’s what’s happening.",(28:09),new jersey
Donald Trump,"But on no issue have Washington Democrats thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration. Left-wing, radical, politician support deadly sanctuary cities, and remember, a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody. Instead, they order them to be released into your community. What the hell is going on? What is going on? Once set loose, these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent Americans. Right here in New Jersey, your state’s Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community.",(29:23),new jersey
Donald Trump,"For example, Cumberland County, we all know Cumberland County very well, right? Good luck with this one. They released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didn’t want to give him to ICE, and I want to thank ICE, because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do. Right here, another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey. The sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ICE request to detain him. Local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder. I could read these cases, honestly, I could read and state these cases to you all night. I could state these cases to you all night. No American should ever be hurt, harmed or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter… Look, look, wait. You have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail. You have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from. By the way, ICE has removed thousands upon thousands of MS-13 gang members, the most brutal people. You don’t want to do that job. Maybe you do, a couple of tough people up there. Anybody want to be with ICE? You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey. New Jersey is different. I think New Jersey is different.",(30:28),new jersey
Donald Trump,"No, but these ICE people, they love our country. They’re proud and they’re tough people, and they’ll go right into a pack. They call it a pack and they start swinging. Everyone’s swinging or they end up standing up. That’s the end of that, and you know what they do? They bring the MS-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador, back to Honduras, back to Guatemala, back to Mexico. I want to thank Mexico because you know what’s happening, right? Thousands and thousands at this moment, 27,000 soldiers from Mexico, protecting our Southern border. I want to thank the President.",(32:28),new jersey
Donald Trump,"Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice, and say what you want, but those are the facts. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members. We are literally taking them by so many, thousands and thousands, and we’re bringing him back. Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row. We have the numbers down by 75% since spring, 75%. We have ended catch and release and really, look, I had another party. I could get anything. If I wanted to spend money on anything, look with the military, we got two trillion dollars, right? More. Two trillion, all made in America, right? Everything. Best planes, best missiles, best everything, made in America. If I wanted to build anything, the only thing they put the whole weight of their party, they didn’t want us to have the wall. They knew it worked. Many of them voted five years ago for a wall. They just didn’t know how to get it built. I do. But what happened is through a series of court cases and other things, the money has won, and we are now building that beautiful wall, and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall, and by next year, we’ll be over 400 miles, and shortly thereafter it will be complete.",(33:11),new jersey
Donald Trump,"A lot of people were saying a year ago, “He didn’t build the wall yet. He didn’t build the wall.” Let me tell you. When you have the strength of a party that has the House, okay, hopefully they’re not going to have the House for long. We’ll have a wonderful new speaker, will get rid of Nancy Pelosi, nervous Nancy, nervous Nancy. We’ll have Kevin McCarthy who’s been fantastic. We have to win back the House. But think of this. The wall, so many people were saying, “Build it.” Well, it’s not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the House, not easy. We did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military, the Army Corps of Engineers anyway, but you know what? Now we actually have the money and it’s going up very rapidly.",(35:21),new jersey
Donald Trump,"In all due respect to Mexico, we like Mexico very much, and we’ve gotten along great with Mexico, and the President’s a friend of mine, and I think he’s doing a fantastic job. It’s a tough situation. But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall. Okay? They’d hit you with that. Now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and it’s an advantage for Mexico, too, when you think about it. The wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities. What we’re doing is stopping drugs at a record number. It’s still anything that comes over is too much, but we’re blocking it at a record number.",(36:20),new jersey
Donald Trump,"I’m also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration. We will now be finally able to enforce federal law, and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs. They were killing our country, killing our country. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. Frankly, they’re crazy. These people are crazy. They’re taking their cues from socialists like Bernie. Left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans, which many people like. The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies. We have them working at the companies, and we have people getting great health care. It’s been so long. It’s finally working and they want to destroy it. The Republican party will never let it happen. We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care, take away your doctors, take away all of the good care that we fought, and we fought hard, and we’re doing well and now we’re doing better. By the way, some time prior to the end of the year, we’re putting in for a new middle income tax cut, a very big one. But we’re making health care better and much, much cheaper. We’ve done a great job in running it and we’ve given you a lot of alternatives. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party, pre-existing conditions, we saved it. We are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent. That’s a big deal, and that will take effect starting in about two months from now. Everything’s transparent. You’ll be able to see pricing. You’ll be able to go and price other hospitals, other doctors. It’s going to be an incredible thing. Nobody believes I was able to do it, but we did it.",(37:03),new jersey
Donald Trump,"We are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice. We are lowering drug prices. The Democrats are increasing drug prices. We are fighting the lobbyists and special interests. We are serving you and how are we doing? We’re doing good, right? But because of price transparency, we are getting it done. We’re approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country. That means they come in, frankly, they’re just as good as the big names, but they sell for 80% less in some cases. We are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds. We are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers. These are all things that we had to fight like hell to get.",(39:50),new jersey
Donald Trump,"We’re making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records, which is a big deal for a lot of people. We are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs. You go home, you say, “Oh, I’m feeling better. The doctor was fantastic,” and then they send you a bill for $25,000. That’s the end of that. All of a sudden the doctor wasn’t so good, right? We are making companies compete for your business. We are repealing burdensome taxes. We have accomplished more than any President in the first three years of their term by far, not even close.",(40:51),new jersey
Donald Trump,"We have provided health insurance options, 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease, HIV, pediatric cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. We’re making so much progress. We have just passed a thing that I think is great. I never understood. For 45 years, they’ve been trying to get it passed. We’ve just passed a thing called Right to Try. You know what that is? So, we have the greatest doctors, the greatest technicians, the greatest labs in the world, and we’ll have a drug that’s looking good, but it’s going to take five more years, and by the way, we’ve brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that, but it takes years to get it approved. You have people that are terminally ill. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help. If they don’t have money, they go home and they die. What we did is a thing called Right to Try.",(41:36),new jersey
Donald Trump,"People sign something and they don’t hold the country responsible. They don’t hold the drug company responsible. It’s called Right to Try, and they get the newest, and the best, and the latest medicine where it’s looking good, but you’re not going to have it for five more years, and you know why they didn’t do it? Because they didn’t want to hurt anybody, except the problem is the people were going to die soon. I said, “They’re terminally ill. Let them have it.” We sat down with a great group of leaders, Republican leaders, and honestly, we had some bipartisan support and we got it done. They’ve been tried to do it for 45 or so years. We got it done.",(42:38),new jersey

You know, I haven’t been doing this that long, so four years ago, I’m campaigning for president. Everyone said, “No, he’s only having fun.” Yeah, it’s some fun. This is a lot of fun. Right?

I am so smart.” I am like the smart- I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online. They’re waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks. Some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors, too long. And I said, “Folks, I have the greatest idea.” All of my people, I say, “I have the greatest idea. I’m so smart. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to send all those people that can’t see a doctor, we just can’t get them to see a doctor.

This has been going on for a long time. No president has wanted to do it. You know how long it took me to make that decision? I said, “If you can say 50%, or 25%, or 15% buy it. Do it.

Donald Trump,"Well thank you very much. And I’m thrilled to be back in Wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago. You remember that very big night? Remember that? They said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.” And since then we’ve produced everything we said and more and more.",(13:19),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Before it was talk. I said, “I’m going to do this. We’re going to take care of your trade.” What we’ve done with China now, on Wednesday we signed, that’s tomorrow. What we’ve done with the US MCA, what we’ve done with Japan, $40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers. South Korea. Oh, you got to love Trump, you got to love Trump.",(13:48),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"And you’re great Green Bay Packers are playing San Francisco this weekend. Good luck. So do we have any Green Bay packer fans here tonight? That’s right. And you have a great quarterback who’s a good guy, a good guy. As we begin the year, our economy is booming, wages are rising, poverty is plummeting. Crime is falling and America is the envy of the entire world.",(14:22),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"And then our opponents say, “We’re not going to win. Let’s impeach President Trump. Let’s impeach him.” We’ve got the greatest economy in our history. Our military has been totally rebuilt. “Let’s impeach him.” But we’ve created 7 million jobs since the election, including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs. Nobody thought that was possible.",(14:58),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"And we will soon be replacing the NAFTA catastrophe, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world, frankly with the incredible US MCA, Canada, Mexico, a giant victory for Wisconsin workers, farmers and dairy producers, a tremendous victory. And we may get that all taken care of this week or next week. It just needs one more vote and we’ll get that out of the Republican Senate. The Republican Senate will be great. Tomorrow we’ll also be signing our phase one trade deal with China, massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of Wisconsin. So after years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States Military to a point that it has never been before and it’s now more advanced, more lethal, and more powerful than ever. And last year, our great American warriors, because that’s what they are. And they love it. I got to tell you, they love it, right? They love doing that. They wouldn’t trade places with me under any circumstances. They wouldn’t trade places with all of our great Wisconsin politicians. They want to be a military warrior and we don’t want them for that. We want them doing what they’re doing. But our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of ISIS. The animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100% destroyed.",(15:37),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"And I will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. Now the caliphate is 100% destroyed. Do you remember when I wanted to leave when it was at 98%? I said, let some of the other countries finish it off. We’re going home, right? They all said, “Oh, no sir, please finish it.” So we finished it off to 100%.",(17:46),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"A few days ago. We took bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice. At my direction, the United States military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world’s number one terrorist, number one terrorist. Do you know who that is? Qasem Soleimani, number one terrorist in the world.",(18:18),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans and was actively planning new attacks, but we stopped them cold. And frankly, they already started the attack, as you saw in Baghdad, on our very large embassy in Baghdad. That was already started. And I said to our generals, “Get there now. We don’t want to have another Benghazi. Not on my watch, or on any watch.”",(18:51),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"They said, “Sir, we’ll be there tomorrow.” I said, “Nope, you got to be there right now. Get them over there now.” There are thousands of soldiers. They were soldiers. You take a look at that crowd. That was not protesters. They were soldiers, and they were surrounding our embassy in Baghdad. And all of a sudden they see these beautiful, very expensive, I will tell you, brand new Apache helicopters roaming over the top. And then they see our great military. You saw them in the plane, right? Some of them were getting out of their pajamas. They were. I said, “Don’t worry about it.” I said, “We won’t put that on.” But they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane. Right? And it was a beautiful sight. And these guys were better than Tom Cruise at his best.",(19:22),milwaukee rally
Crowd,Booo!,(20:22),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"All right. So tomorrow with the fake news, here’s your headline. We have thousands of people outside wanting to get into and they can’t, because you people got here first. But so here’s your headline tomorrow: Protestors Disturb the Rally. One protester, a very weak voice. If you people wouldn’t go crazy every time you see something, he’d go right through and nobody would even know she was there. Now she’s going home to mom where she will be in big trouble.",(21:18),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Because I guarantee you that mom voted for Trump. And in 10 years from now, when I run yet again, she’ll be voting for Trump too. I’m only kidding. I’m only kidding. We drive them crazy. We drive them crazy. They say, “You know he’s not leaving, don’t you? He’s never leaving.” They say, “He’s going to win. He’s never going to leave.” These people, it’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome. It really is. You know what they don’t know is that if for any reason, after five years we do leave, which we will, because I believe in that stuff. Right? But you know what’s going to happen to their industry. They’re all going to die and fold up. Going to be very boring out there, very boring. That’s why I say at some point, every single one of them will be endorsing Donald Trump.",(22:00),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"But crazy Bernie Sanders and the Washington Democrats, by the way, Bernie is surging. Bernie is surging. Bernie. But the Democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death.",(23:18),milwaukee rally
Crowd,Boo! Boo!,(23:42),milwaukee rally
Crowd,USA! USA! USA!,(23:42),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"That’s two. Hey, speaking of protesters, have you seen what’s happened in Iran? The protesters are on our side. First time ever. They’re on our side. In fact, they put this big American flag on the street. And the Iranians, thousands and thousands of Iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it. Every one of them went around that flag. They like Trump. They like you. I’m just your representative, but they like us. They like us. They haven’t seen anything like that in a long time. They went around, did you see it? They went around the flag. They didn’t want to touch it. They love America. They love our country. That’s called progress. That’s called progress.",(24:23),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"But the Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster. Many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms, without legs and without … were done by Soleimani. That’s what he loved. He loved the roadside bomb. That’s what he loved. Thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq, in Afghanistan, roadside bombs. He was the king of the roadside bombs. Great percentages of people don’t have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch.",(25:26),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Now the Democrats should be outraged by Soleimani’s evil crimes, not that decision to end his wretched life. They’re saying, “Well, he was a general. He was this. He was that.” You know what? Number one, he wasn’t supposed to be there. He was a designated terrorist by president Obama who didn’t do anything about it as usual. As usual, they don’t do anything. They designate and they don’t do anything about. He should’ve been killed 20 years ago.",(26:06),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Now, here’s the story with the Democrats. If I didn’t kill him, and let’s say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed, they would have said, “Trump should have taken him out.” Anything we do, they go the opposite. So we kill him. And that was precision. Some people thought it went much too fast. Went too fast. So we kill him and they say, “What a horrible …” If we didn’t kill him, they’d say, “What a horrible thing.” Right?",(26:53),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"You know with the wall, we’re building the wall. You know that right? [inaudible 00:27:36] And by the way, they think they caught me. They never catch us. Because Mexico’s paying for the wall. You know that. You’ll see that. It’s all worked out. Mexico’s paying. It’s driving them crazy. Now they say, “Okay, he’s building the wall. But Mexico didn’t pay.” Mexico will pay. And here’s the thing. You’ll see that it’ll come out. We’ll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before. Our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch, because nobody’s watching.",(27:28),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"haven’t been doing great on the debates. I have to tell you. But we are building this wall. We’re over 100 miles right now. We’re going to be expanding the length. You have a lot of natural where you have 1,978 miles. You need 500 miles, but 700 would be good, 750 or so would be great. We’re going to now get it up. We have all the financing. You think it’s easy getting financing when people put … I can get anything from them. I can get whatever I want in terms of money except for a wall. And I made one big mistake. I should have said to them, “We will not build the wall. We don’t want the wall.” They would have insisted that we build it. We would have had all the money we wanted. I made a mistake. I made a big mistake. Now we’re building the wall. It’s going up and it’s going up rapidly and very soon we’ll be building about a mile a day. And we should be up to over 400 miles by next year, the end of next year, and shortly thereafter it’ll be finished. And it’s already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country.",(28:14),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country, nor do they want to, I think. According to Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, who has somewhat less Indian blood in her than I do, and I have none. Remember? Oh, we hit her hard. But I hit her too early, but now it doesn’t matter. She’s not going anywhere. But Bernie said, according to her, Bernie said, and I don’t believe that he said this, because I don’t know him. I don’t particularly like him. He’s a nasty guy. But I don’t believe he said it. It’s not his field. You have to know what people say. She said, right, that Bernie stated strongly that a woman can’t win for president. A woman can win for president. Fortunately that could happen. Who knows?",(29:31),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"But she said that Bernie said, “A woman can’t win.” I don’t believe that Bernie said that. I really don’t know. Just it’s not the kind of a thing he’d say. If you want to keep America safe, just vote Republican. We’re doing so well. We’re doing so well. Now this was … leave him alone. That’s all right. Let security just take care of her.",(30:39),milwaukee rally

Donald Trump,"And is there ever, ever a better place to be than a Trump rally on some night during some week? The truth, is we have a great time. But you know what? More importantly we get things done. We’re getting everything done. But even president Obama’s own former National Security Advisor, a highly respected general named Jim Jones, praised our action to take out Soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do. I’m sure they like him very much. He sounds like our kind of a guy. So Jim, if they’ve given you a hard time, come on over to the Republican party. No, he’s a respected guy. He said we did the right thing.",(31:51),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Everyone knows. They’re saying, “Was the attack eminent? Was it eminent?” Does the fact that he’s killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of Americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands? That doesn’t matter. Was the attack eminent? I think they’re going to start a new investigation. Was the attack or this horror … and by the way, he was in a country he wasn’t allowed to be in. We don’t mention that because he was designated and he wasn’t allowed to be there. And he was there with the head of Hezbollah, and they were talking about, like Hillary Clinton. They were talking about weddings and working out. Soleimani and the head of Hezbollah, they were talking about weddings, working out.",(32:46),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Or Bill Clinton in the back of the airplane with the Attorney General, where they may have made her an offer that you’re going to go to the Supreme Court. Or they may have said, “You’re going to to stay Attorney General, but help. Help.” They may have said that. Do you think they would have said that? No. Nothing like that. But do you remember? They talked about golf and grandchildren, right? 45 minutes. I like golf.",(33:36),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"45 minutes. I like golf and I love my grandchildren. I don’t think I can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that I don’t even know. 45. I have a beautiful grandchild. He’s really beautiful. He’s so great. Okay. What else am I going to say, right? Then I took a… Let’s talk one or two. How’s Tiger doing? How’s this one? How’s that one? That’s another five minutes, right? What am I going to do with the other 35 minutes? Maybe I’m going to talk about Supreme court appointments, et cetera.",(34:03),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Well, we’re doing very well. But at this very moment, the good people of Iran are taking to the streets in numbers like nobody’s seen before, and they’re really protesting the repressive regime and demanding a better future. They’re great people. The great people of Iran, the great people, they get it. And they’re tired of watching their leaders plunder around to stoke violence and death and war. And you know, Iran’s caused us problems for 40 years. Just so you understand, Reagan had it. Iran Contra. Carter had it. 52 hostages. How about that? Destroyed his presidency. It was pretty well destroyed before that in all fairness. But it didn’t help. Actually probably got Reagan elected, if you think about it, right? But no, carter had it, 52 hostages. Reagan had Iran Contra. Obama had just… He was begging them for everything, but Obama gave them $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash [inaudible 00:01:46].",(34:35),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"Got zero. He got zero out of it. He got zero. I’d love to have that money back. It’s a lot of money. But I’ve warned the Ayatollah and the government of Iran that they must not harm, hurt, or kill any protesters. The whole world is watching. It’s watching.",(35:48),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"They’ve killed thousands of protests. We support the Iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom. It’s incredible what’s going on over there. It really is. But we’re watching it. We’re watching very closely. And we were ready. That night when the attack was made on us, attack was made on us. Remember this, they killed an American, they killed other people just before that. And so we did what we did, right? And they said, it’s our turn now. I said, you better be careful when you say it’s our turn. Because we had designated targets that you wouldn’t know… It would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible. It’s true, it’s true. And we saw those missiles launched, and they were big and they were fast, and they were accurate. Four of them went bad. They fell way short. But 12 of them hit. And I said, man, they are quick. They knew immediately what they were, and they saw those missiles hit. I said, how bad is it? It hit a base. And an hour later or so, we get a call back. I said, how many killed? Nobody, sir.",(36:16),milwaukee rally
Donald Trump,"I said, how many hurt? They said, nobody, sir. And I said, they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives. That’s true. A trillion, not a billion. A trillion.

Let’s get rid of Gaddafi. How’s that working out? Right? Let’s get rid of Gaddafi. That was a Hillary deal. Then you had Benghazi. And see Benghazi, they didn’t respond. They didn’t respond. Should be. Should be.",(37:43),milwaukee rally

I’m looking at the audience, there’s about three of you that want to be in that zone, okay? And you’re very tough people. But this is the most dangerous… I call it, I call it the safe zone. Some day it may be a safe zone, but I took our soldiers out, because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here, and they were going to fight. I said, if they’re going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years, for centuries, let them fight. But we’re getting the hell out of there, okay?

He’s probably looking down or looking up, and he’s probably saying, these people have gone crazy. That’s the nicest call I’ve ever tracked. Somebody said, I never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call. But this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of Ukraine said there was no pressure on us. Didn’t even know what they were talking about. The foreign minister said they want to impeach. Impeach the president of the United States over a perfect phone call. It’s the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country.

Nancy Pelosi says it must be nonpartisan. And she said, it has to be clear cut. Well, number one, never happened. No problem. Number two, look at the vote. Three Democrats voted with us. So I guess you could say it was a nonpartisan vote because they voted with us, okay? But we’re going back and we’re going to hold the Senate.

Under just three years of by administration, 3.5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible. 370 companies have signed our pledge to America’s workers providing more than 14 million Americans with new training and job opportunities. We’re training them. We’re getting them, Walmart, so many great companies, they’re training people, because they can train a much better than government. 14 million, you know who has worked so hard on that? Everybody, you’ve heard of Ivanka, right? Ivanka. She had such a passion for it. She’s very smart. I said, would you like this? You have no debt. I want to get people working. I want to get them and help families. So I said, all right, good. Look, she’s smart. Go do whatever the hell you want to do, it’s okay, darling. So she had a goal of a half a million people. She was going to get trained, get into companies. So she’d call Walmart, she’d call Exxon, she’d call all these great companies. And all of a sudden she hit 8 million. Then she hit 9 million.

And the new bulb, I don’t know if you see it, it’s on there. It’s a hazardous waste. When that bulb ends, you’re supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it’s loaded up with gasses.

You end up using it ten times, and the plates, then you take them out and doing the old fashioned way, right? But what do you do? You’re spending ten times for the electricity, right? So I’m putting the water back. Most places have so much water, they don’t know what the hell to do with it. A lot of people don’t realize that. So dishwashers now, you’re going to have just as much as you’ve ever had, and you’re going to use now one shot. Your dishes are going to be beautiful.

And environmentally, it’s better, because now people … the number is 12. From 12 years ago, with the old gas guzzlers, they’ll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars, which they don’t do right now.

In the city of Madison, police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault. After authorities released him, he committed violent battery, only to be released one more time. They’re looking for him again. Isn’t that nice? The same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in September and charged with multiple sexual assaults, including sexual assault of a child.

We killed thousands and thousands of ISIS warriors, fighters, and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be. Nobody has ever done what we’ve done in three years.

And when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors, when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage, it’s most likely that he caused that damage, because that’s what he liked.

We now have a wonderful deal. And if we didn’t have a good deal, you know what I would have done what? What? I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it, right? That would have been it. Unfortunately the deal’s been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened? And she had a lot of pressure, especially from manufacturing areas, farm areas, a lot of pressure to sign it. So here’s what happens. So I get along with labor. I had a lot of union labor vote for me, tremendous amount of labor. In New York where I come from, we have a lot of unions. And that’s okay. That’s fine. So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed, we’ll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal.

The taxes were taking it down, instead of being up 92% or whatever you’re up, a lot, you would have been down, you would have been at less than half. It was crashing. For all those people that would say, “Oh, it’s the Obama…” Let me tell you something. You were dying.

If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom, those cameras will turn to those two seats and they’ll say “Trump wasn’t able to fill up the arena.” I always get nervous when I see some… I know they’re coming back.

You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed, because it looks like you’re doing badly. They do that. I think it’s almost worse than what they write, and you can’t get much worse than what they write. So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary, his very dishonest wife, Crooked Hillary.

Every time I went there with these crowds. So we won Wisconsin. We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel … where is Ronna? Where is Ronna? Ronna, she was so horrible. I didn’t know her, Ronna McDaniel, and she was so aggressive. She kept calling and said, “Could you please come out to Michigan?” I said, “Who the hell are you?” And I said, “What do you mean, another trip?” So anyway, I made, we had these big crowds.

So now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago? They tried to say that he’s not a strong person, that he was weak. They used the word weak, that he was weak, and under the power of Trump, he said. Do you know how insulting that is? Anybody that becomes president of a country, and that’s a big country and it’s a tough country, you got to be tough. He’s tough.

If you want to buy the newer kind, you can. And if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind, like I do. So we’re bringing back the old light bulb. So it’s a much less expensive, it probably gives a better light. But whatever it is, and you’ll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb. I mean, it sounds like little, but it’s big stuff.

Unemployment is at a position we’ve never had anything like this. You are so lucky I became your president. I’m only kidding. I have to say I’m kidding because the fake news back there will take that. They’ll take that statement and they’ll blow it up and they’ll say, “He said they were lucky to have him as president. What a horrible thing to say.” Because they’re fake. Anyway, here in Pennsylvania you had the single best year that you’ve ever had in the history of our country, not bad. The Pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low. And I hate to tell you this, when I was campaigning three and a half years ago, I’d come here, you weren’t doing so well, folks. You weren’t doing so well. Wages were way down, unemployment was way up. It wasn’t a pretty picture.

Donald Trump,"Then came NAFTA, the NAFTA disaster, I call it, one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs.

And I’m thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the NAFTA catastrophe once and for all. Congress will soon vote on my new trade deal, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement or USMCA. After years of waiting, many, many years, many, many decades, they’ve been looking for this, and then we got it done and we’ve been waiting for a long time for Nancy Pelosi to announce USMCA and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the United States and your favorite president, I think.",(06:16),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"And the reason they announced it on the same day, one hour later, they announce impeachment, a few guys standing behind her. They announced the impeachment, and then an hour later, she announced that she’s going to USMCA. You know why? It’s a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment, and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment.",(07:23),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"And think of it this way also, the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that’s the reason they approved USMCA. So that’s okay with me, because they approved it and they’re very happy to have it. But honestly, it’s an incredible deal for our country. Took too long, it waited in Congress for too long a time. Incredible deal, and replacing the worst, NAFTA.",(07:57),hershey pennsylvania

And I have to say this about the Republicans, the Republicans… And you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your Congressman. You have a lot of great ones, these congressmen are great.

That particular guy wanted to be so politically correct. We don’t want to be politically correct. I don’t know who he was, he didn’t do the greatest job, so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous… It all started with the Russia witch hunt. Then the inspector general shocking report proved that the Obama FBI obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears, paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC.",(14:55),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"The FBI failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the Pfizer court. They hid it, they deceived it, and they lied. The dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote, “Desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the United States president.” What’s this? Folks, they spied on our campaign, they spied. Never happened before in the history of our country and we’re really wise to it. We’re wise to it.",(16:48),hershey pennsylvania

When the FBI… And you have great people in the FBI, but not in leadership. You have not good people in leadership, you haven’t had. When the FBI uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning, they hid that exonerating, you know that? They hid it. They hid it so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years. They knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a set up, but they hid it so that nobody could see it, so they could keep it going on, thinking they were going to hurt us politically. But now we’re stronger politically than we were ever before. And the FBI also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign. Look how they’ve hurt people. They’ve destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people. Their lives have been destroyed by scum, by scum. An FBI lawyer forged, took an email… forged, forged an email used as evidence, an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral.",(17:31),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"What they did is so unbelievable. Oh, I look forward… I don’t know. I don’t know, keep away. I look forward to Bull Durham’s report, that’s the one I look forward to. And this report was great by the IG, especially since he was appointed by President Barack Hussein Obama. Considering that fact, it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously, although I suspect we would have. We also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti- Trump and anti-Trump people hatred and bias, texting about an insurance policy, let’s have an insurance… remember?

The fake news will never report it, but it could be true.",(21:02),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"No, that’s what I heard. I don’t know. I mean who could believe a thing like that? No, I heard that Peter Strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover. Ah, Lisa, I hope you’re miss him. Lisa, he’ll never be the same. But he said he’s not ever going to become president and Strzok look back, “No, no, he won’t. We’ll stop it. We’ll stop it.” Can you believe we found these texts? This is FBI agents at a high level. “No, no. We’ll stop it.” They’re going to stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen, “There was no bias. Oh, there was no bias.”",(21:35),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"Think of these people, they write here was no bias. And yet he saying, “No, no, darling, we’ll stop it.” And then they announce there was no bias. Now you know what we’re doing, and it’s not easy, and somebody said a regular president… I don’t want to use the word normal because that’s not a nice normal refer… A regular president would have been under a table, thumb in the mouth saying, “Take me home mommy, this is too tough for me.” It’s true. True, they know.",(22:21),hershey pennsylvania

It’s one thing, but very tough on a family thing, a thing like this happens, it’s a disgrace. But day after day we’re exposing something called that filthy, disgusting, horrible swamp and we’re cleaning it up. And now after and a half years now that the Russia witch hunt is dead, a big fat disgusting fraud, the Congressional Democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with Ukraine, but that’s already failing.",(23:09),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"You saw their so-called articles of impeachment today, people are saying they’re not even a crime. What happened? All of these horrible things, remember? Bribery and this and that. Where are they? They send these two things and not even a crime. This is the lightest, weakest impeachment…. Our country has had actually many impeachments, you recall judges and lots of… many impeachments, but it was on today, everybody said, “This is impeachment light.” This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far. It’s not even like an impeachment. These people are stone cold crooked.",(24:08),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"When a guy like shifty Schiff, he’s a corrupt politician, he made up my statement because… See, I did one thing very good, as soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements.

Donald Trump,"Remember the second whistleblower was coming, right? And then the informer, who is the informer? I know who the informer is. So the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report, they wrote something totally different from what I said, what I said was perfect. But it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that. They didn’t even know probably that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word for word transcribed, so beautiful. Am I lucky I had it transcribed? Think of that. Think of that.",(25:28),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"So when I said release it… And I don’t like doing that because you’re releasing it, it’s a conversation with a foreign leader, in this case, a very fine gentlemen, president of Ukraine, the new president of Ukraine. And we call them up and we said, “Would it be okay?” Our secretary of state made the call, “Would it be okay?” And they didn’t know what we were talking about, but they said, “Yeah, it’s okay.” And by the way, he, his foreign minister, everybody did you know they said, “There was no pressure. He didn’t do anything wrong. There was no pressure put on us.” That didn’t stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up. Now, all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower. We never heard about who the informer was.",(26:09),hershey pennsylvania

Donald Trump,"He’s gone. Maybe our great Congressmen can find him. Okay? But the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly, and the IG, who didn’t want to look at the conversation, he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to Congress so that Congress could have fun with it, ought to be ashamed of himself.",(27:03),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"But today, the House Democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment. The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed. With today’s announcement, they’re now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice, and there were no crimes whatsoever. There are no crimes. It says that, there are no crimes. They’re impeaching me and there are no crimes. This has to be a first in history. They’re impeaching me. You know why? Because they want to win an election. And that’s the only way they can do it.",(27:24),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"So the Democrats have nothing, and they’ve turned the somber process of impeachment. And it was, you know, to me, impeachment is a very ugly word. It’s a word I associate with some very bad times in our country. The good news is we’re having the best times in history in our country. Okay? But the word impeachment, to me, is a very, very ugly word. It’s a dark, ugly word. But, but I have to tell you, as bad as it is, it meant something. When you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors, when you had serious, go ahead, it’s impeachment. That would happen every 50 years, every 40 years, every 100 years. This was a big deal. They’re making it so like, “Let’s do it every six months.” They’ve cheapened a process. They’ve cheapened a process.",(28:06),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"These people are so bad, the radical left Democrats, and I actually think that Pelosi, who by the way, by the way, by the way, she has totally lost control. She has totally … It’s being run now by this crazy AOC plus three. AOC plus three. Now it’s being run by other people. The far left has just grabbed that party. It is so sad to see. And she knew what would happen.",(29:03),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"I didn’t, because I didn’t figure the polls would go through the roof. They went out today. In Michigan, in Wisconsin, in a place called Pennsylvania. No, no. The polls are through the roof. They’re called swing states, very important states. We won Pennsylvania the last time, and we’re going to win it again, but even bigger. Our polls have gone, over the last month, they’ve gone through the roof. You look at it, take a look at it, it came out today. The FireHouse poll, it’s an important poll. It was always good. I never looked at it. Today, I like it a lot. We’re up through … nobody can even believe it.",(29:40),hershey pennsylvania
Donald Trump,"So what Pelosi did, and as I said, they do the impeachment, then right away, let’s do USMCA, right on top of it. You’d think she’d wait like a day. She wanted to smother the impeachment crap, and that’s probably what she did, at least to an extent. But any Democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority, their dignity, and their career. Okay? And some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time, think of this. How about Low IQ Maxine Waters? How about Green? How about Green? We’ve Green. How about Green, where he said, “We have to impeach him because if we don’t impeach him we’re not going to win the election.”",(30:28),hershey pennsylvania

You’re the elite. They’re not the elite. You’re the elite. You’re the elite. You got better education. You got better everything. You’re the elite. It always bothers me, they said, “The elite.” This is the elite. Look at these people. How beautiful. This is the elite. You know who are the elite? You look at those jobs reports.

Just like these gentlemen in the House. So solid. So we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office. And in 2020 I’m going to work like hell that we take over the House. We have to take over the House. We have to. Right? Got to take over the House, Mike. So here are the facts that Shifty Schiff … Is that guy the worst? He comes up to a microphone, now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago, “I have absolute proof that the President of the United States conspired with Russia.” Russia? What the hell do I have to do with Russia? By the way, Russia wishes that Hillary Clinton won. They wish. We are now number one in the world in energy. Russia is number three.

And right now, we’re by far the largest economy in the world.

She always thought I was a total stiff, a dumb, stupid dope. Now she thinks I’m a financial genius, sir. And all I did was buy some stock. I have stock in a 401k, and you made me into a genius, sir. She loves me so much more than she ever did.” Shows you the power of money, right? Isn’t that terrible? But I have so many people, 401ks are through the roof, your jobs are through the roof, we have the lowest unemployment rate.

You have so many opportunities right now. Wages are up, jobs are up. And today we set a new record, almost 160 million people are working. We’ve never come close to that number. That’s a hell of a number. But just quickly, here are the facts on Shifty Schiff. Dishonest guy, makes up my statements. He said, “The President of Ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure,” but he didn’t want to say that. We said, “Say it. Say it, you crooked bastard, say it.

They gave me about a day, and that’s okay, because the people understand, we made a great decision. And remember this, al-Baghdadi was the founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi was a vicious, ruthless person, al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the State of Ohio. Think of that, that’s a big caliphate. And we now have taken 100% of the caliphate, and we have thousands and thousands of ISIS prisoners. With Obama, you did nothing. You did nothing but get your ass kicked. True. True. All right, we’re joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways. They fight for us.

And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he’s had to do some things that you had to do. And he’s done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you’ve ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We’re supporting our police, we’re rebuilding our military, we’re defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world’s number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We’ve rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again.",(02:34),kentucky rally
Donald Trump,"But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody’s touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that’s running against Matt. They’re after your Second Amendment. We can’t let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight.",(05:21),kentucky rally
Donald Trump,"The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can’t be broken. You’re too strong and you’re too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me.",(06:36),kentucky rally
Donald Trump,"You remember last week. I don’t know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don’t know Jill Stein. She’s a Greenie and that’s fine. She’s a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What’s happened is San Francisco and what’s happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it’s unbelievable.",(07:56),kentucky rally

There’s been no place in the country that’s gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she’s wasting all of her time. And you know what, it’s backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it.

Your 401(k)s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they’ve been running the 401(k)s for years. And they totally lost respect for let’s say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he’s a financial genius because he’s up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that’s not going down by 50%, that’s going down to nothing. It’s going to be worthless.

Donald Trump,"You’ll have a depression the likes of which you’ve never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don’t have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don’t forget, that was zero interest. We’re paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans.

What they don’t know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they’re going crazy.

And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we’re 58 and 0, that’s a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that’s a good. We’re 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week’s vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they’re not going to win in 2020. So let’s see what can we do to win, but that’s not working too well. You’ll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who’s done a great job. Matt’s a veteran. He’s a patriot. He’s done it all. He’s been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he’s done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult.

Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, “Matt, do I have to do it?” Please, please. But isn’t that really what you wanted in a governor? That’s what you want. He’s such a pain in the ass, but that’s what you want. And the job he’s done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He’s been incredible.

The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I’m going to count but I think it’s like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 … I’m going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I’m off by half a point. If it’s 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it.

This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even … Let’s just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don’t know.

And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven’t heard about the whistleblower after that, have you?

What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They’re not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren’t leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let’s do this, I said to our great now first lady.

But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you’ve ever had, he’s going to destroy it. And it won’t be long. It’ll go very quickly. You know, you’re all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs.

Beshear doesn’t represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he’s backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he’s funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in.

Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I’m serious about this. This guy works so hard. He’s a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out.

When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob.

Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we’re going to introduce him, but he beat her.

I came in and I said, “How many do we have?” They said, “How many what, sir?” I said, “Judge openings.” And I thought they’d say none, or one or two. He said, “Sir, we have 142.” I said, “What?” I said, “Tell me again.” He said, “We have 142.” So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he’s really become a good friend of mine. And I’ll tell you, he’s a little bit different. It’s okay.

You better start going.” “No, no, no. The polls say everything’s good.” And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years.

I’m afraid if he gets a nomination, he’ll be so slow we’ll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary.

Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables. He was standing on countertops. I said, “Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?” But he’s waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, “What the hell is he doing?

And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen. And I’m on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, “Please, could you help me please?” I don’t know who he is. I didn’t know his name until I looked down the card, I see. And he’s a nice guy, and hopefully he’s going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems. And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason… Why isn’t Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren’t they doing things that they’re supposed to do? Why is it always the United States?",(29:13),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect. It was perfect. It wasn’t like almost… It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, “Could you call and say hello?” Now I’m an honest person, anyway.

Many people.",(30:23),mississippi rally

You had policy experts, junior aids, low-level staffers, probably [apprenti 00:00:20]. Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people. And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president. I guarantee he’s got a lot of people listening, too. These people are sick.",(31:03),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"So corrupt politician, Shifty Adam Schiff, actually stood before Congress and stood before the American people and made up a conversation that he said I had with the Ukrainian president. Unfortunately … No, think of it. And many people saw that, and it was a terrible … He said terrible things. The president of Ukraine said it was a very good conversation, there was no pressure. His foreign minister said the same thing: no pressure. They must think we’re nuts, to be honest. It’s all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let’s give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we’ve ever had.",(31:38),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don’t quit. But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe. So I quote, “I said” … Let me act like him. I’ve got to speak really slow though, and … “I said, ‘You’re not getting a billion.’ I looked at them and I said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn’t fired, you’re not getting the money. You understand? You’re not getting the money.'” Then he goes, at the end … I didn’t know he had this kind of energy. He goes, “Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.”",(32:45),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn’t think he had the energy, the brain power. It’s turned out he doesn’t. By the way, he’s dropping like a rock. When you’re at 1%, there’s always a reason. He should be there fairly soon. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was $1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son’s company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young … How old are you?",(33:37),mississippi rally

I call him Fredo, like from the movie.",(34:44),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn’t know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said, “I don’t know these people. I don’t know them. I don’t know them.”",(35:25),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"He never spoke to his son about getting millions of dollars. No, he never spoke to him. Didn’t happen to speak to him. Think of this: we’re dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That’s why I like Beto, he wasn’t smart, couldn’t handle it. I told my wife, I said, “See, it’s not so easy.”",(35:40),mississippi rally

Donald Trump,"But Biden said, “I never met the people, never met the gentlemen.” Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they’re playing golf together, but he never met him.

I never mentioned the fact that they’re paying my son millions.” Oh, no, no, no.",(36:26),mississippi rally

It’s hard to be broadcasting that when you’re talking about the network that has you on, right? So, we understand. Their light’s off. And then, remember this: Anderson [inaudible 00:00:38:06]. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don’t want anything to do with him. They were love fests.

Donald Trump,"We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don’t know, you probably read it. We threw them out at the White House. We don’t show them anymore. If somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out. And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? We had a tee shirt made, “Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter?”",(38:31),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the Morning Show. That was the last we’ve seen of Hunter. That wasn’t good. The morning of his father’s very bad debate, but it’s, where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don’t have them in the White House. I said, “No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don’t” …",(38:58),mississippi rally

And I’d go into these offices; I’d see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. I keep trying to figure out who’s worse. And one day it’s the Times, one day it’s the Post. It’s like top each other, they’re so bad. It’s so phony. In my opinion, it’s virtually corrupt. I’ve never seen it. You never have a good story. I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from?",(39:27),mississippi rally

I didn’t do it for the story. I did it because it’s the right thing to do. But if I were a Democrat, they’d be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don’t even want to … They actually played it down. And actually, and I’m happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me. And I’m very happy with that. I’m very … Conan is incredible. And Conan’s coming to the White House in a few weeks.",(40:46),mississippi rally
Donald Trump,"But it is true. Did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They’d be talking about his bravery. Oh, so bravery. But again, 142 judges he gave us. Remember that. How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts. Great ones. Great judge. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever? Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with?",(41:37),mississippi rally

We’re taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we’re doing with some of it? Just a small portion, but 100%, they’re taking care of … Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. So they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing. And they thought our farmers would say, “Oh, we don’t like Trump.” They did just the opposite. They said, “We know he’s doing the right thing because we’ve been ripped off for so many years.”",(43:10),mississippi rally

They would have said it’s impossible. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years, soon to be historic. African-American unemployment just dropped to the lowest rate ever recorded; historic.

To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average $2,000 to $2,500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What’s happening?

China.” You ask President Putin, “How many countries are you protecting President Putin?” And he looks and he goes, “Russia.” You ask other countries … we’re protecting at least 94.

Which one?” So I did all three because it’s a different form of cutting. You can cut through steel, but you can’t through the concrete and then you can’t through the hardened rebar. We got it all. “And we also need see-through, sir. Got to see who’s on the other side.” That makes sense, right? Not just concrete.

What they want to teach your kids, not good. They come home, mommy, daddy, this is what I learned. And you’re going, oh no, don’t tell me. Let’s get them into another school fast. They want to disarm law abiding citizens. They want to take your guns away. They want to install far left judges to shred our constitution. It’s not happening.

I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, except in the case of myself where they use it against me. The radical left tolerates no dissent. It permits no opposition.

Who’s the whistleblower? Who’s the whistleblower? Who is the whistleblower? We have to know. Is the whistleblower a spy? And who is the IG that did this? All he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down, the transcribed version of the phone call. Compare that to the whistle blower’s account and you see it had nothing to do with it.

Donald Trump,"True. He said to me, I just told him call me … He said, “President, I can’t do it.” He said. So he says, “President, you’ve been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe we’re here three years?” We, we, it’s we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years. Okay? No more. No more. 16 more years. I’m only kidding. Now they’ll go back. See, he wants to run for more. But he said, “President, could I ask you a question? It’s so important to me.” He’s a great businessman, very successful. He said, “You deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful … Who is the worst to deal with? Is it China? Is it North Korea? Is India? Is it Russia? Please tell me, Mr. Pres, who is the toughest nation to deal with?” I said, “You’re not going to believe this. It’s the USA is the toughest nation to deal with.” The USA.",(50:04),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"It’s true. Because we’re dealing with some very sick and deranged people. There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control. They’re trying to stop me because they know that I don’t answer to them, I answer to you. It’s true. I never say this. I don’t think I’ve ever said it in a speech, but they’ll find out if I did. They’ll give me Pinocchios, he said it before, but I don’t know if I ever said this before. But I make, as president, about $450,000. I give it away. I don’t care. I don’t want it.",(51:25),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didn’t. I give it away to … You can only give it, you can’t keep it. You can’t actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time. Now, and if I ever did … But it’s 450. If somebody stays from, let’s say, a middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don’t want to hear about him, they say, “Trump is getting rich off our nation.”",(52:26),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"I lose billions being president. I don’t care. It’s nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees, I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say, “Emoluments.” Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. I tell you, it’s cost me billions of dollars to be president. It really has. And at some point I’ll probably to prove that, and I look forward to doing it.. It’s very easy. It’s very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created.",(53:11),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"So in desperate attempt to attack our movement. Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota’s own representative Ilhan Omar. I know you people. I know you people. I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also, at the same time, it’s both a question and a statement, how’d the hell did that ever happen? How did it happen? How did it happen? Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland. Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, “Some people did something big deal. Some people did something.” She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda. You remember that tape? Speak of Al-Qaeda. But when we say something about the United States, you just don’t say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not. She’s said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States.",(54:16),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I’m very angry at you people right now. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I’m going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months.",(56:48),minnesota rally

Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff, I can’t believe it. Where’s Scott? Where’s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is, Scott, it’s incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about. The problem is they never pick it up. They don’t want to pick it up, but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. And Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name.",(57:13),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"Scott reports his sources told him that, quote, Omar’s legal husband was Omar’s brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes. You mean like coming into the United States, maybe? And as Scott says, “We have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like Omar’s in Congress, and nothing gets done about it.” I hope that some of you people are looking, because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing and what … I call it AOC plus three, that’s what it is. And Omar is one of the three. What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse, and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it’s not fair. The fact is, we’re in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand-",(58:46),minnesota rally

We had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico, and New Mexico’s a hard state for Republicans, hasn’t been won in a long time also. And we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic, where we’re doing great. And you know, Hispanic, they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do.",(01:02:50),minnesota rally

That’s why we’re doing so well, but we’re in New Mexico, and I’m telling you, that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We haven’t had any bad ones. We haven’t. They’re all electric. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn’t been won in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason, but it hadn’t been won.",(01:03:36),minnesota rally

She’s giving me a headache.” “Sir, if you make one more trip, you’re going to win Michigan.” I say, “All right,” I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, “Sir, we need one more.” This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said, “Who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan and speak just one more time every week? One more time, sir.”",(01:04:09),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"And her name is Ronna McDaniel. She’s fantastic, and she’s the head of the RNC. She’s great. And our campaign manager, a man who’s really been… They used to say that Crooked Hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign. After she lost, they said, “I guess it wasn’t sophisticated.” We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy. Brad Parscale.

If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it’s a nicer building and you can rent for less, you’re really… That’s like a good thing.” So in the campaign, we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary Clinton, much. And we won. And we won.",(01:05:39),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"We won 306 to 223. That’s a pretty big… Remember? Remember they said electoral college. By the way, when you run, if you’re running, the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash, and the total vote, you don’t go certain places. You focus. Electoral college. We have to explain to them, it’s different. So we won 306, and do you remember they sued to say one’s the 100 yard dash. You practice. One’s the mile. You practice. It’s a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states. For the total vote, I’d go to four states maximum, right? Much easier. It’s much easier.",(01:06:17),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"I’m all for it, but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn’t go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point. Maine gave me one point. And what happened? What happened? I went there numerous times. Everyone said, “Why?” Because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get… They had me maximum, if everything worked, right? At 269. So I kept going to Maine, and you know what? We won that one point in Maine. We won it.",(01:07:03),minnesota rally

There’s no way of doing it, and they were right. I got to 306. They were right. But I didn’t get to 306. You got to 306. We won incredible states. We won incredible states.

I was the messenger, but we all worked hard. That was our victory, not my victory.

And these guys don’t even question it. They just sit back and say, “I guess he’s right about that.” I’ll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy.

They’d come in, they’d sing. They got Bruce Springsteen. Okay? He’d do about two songs and leave.

And he’s talking about this lousy mayor they’ve got. Now, he didn’t quite say that, but I say it. He’s talking about this lousy mayor that won’t let the cops, the police, the law enforcement… My father always used to say, “Son…” And he meant it to. “Never say cops. It’s disrespectful.

But I see this guy, and I don’t know if he’s done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good.

Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Great people. Thank you. What a group. I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls.",(01:21:05),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"And I’ve done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise. I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that’s what you have the right to do right now. And believe me, no other president would be doing that.",(01:22:13),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think you have it bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do. But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota. We’ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. The president of Mexico has been incredible. We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They’re great, and they’re tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this. Thank you Mr. President. We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores. We’re not going to allow it to happen. And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the world’s most dangerous countries.",(01:23:12),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said… They were talking about the travel ban, and they said, “Well you know, the president has lost in court.” They said, “Where?” “On the travel ban.” And he’s right. I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court. Right? And he knew that, but he said I lost on the… And he was right. I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban. But instead of saying, “He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court,” he said, “He lost on the travel ban.”",(01:25:14),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"These are very dishonest people. Do you understand that? Very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we’re not letting it happen anymore. Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking historic action to secure the border. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built. And this is a serious wall. You’ve all seen it. It’s going up rapidly, and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me.

That’s the biggest patchwork of financing you’ve ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it’s largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted. I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, “What do you want?

We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we’re building. It also, unfortunately… The bad news, it’s also the most expensive.

That’s the only reason. And I just thought of it a year ago. I said, “Man, this could’ve been so much easier.” All I had to do is say, “We don’t want a wall,” and they would’ve given me all the financing I wanted for the wall. What was I thinking? We’re not going to build a wall, and they would have forced me to build it. I would’ve… It’s true. Under this administration, we are also ending the-",(01:29:08),minnesota rally

They don’t let us fight.” I said, “I let you fight.” I said, “How come if they say it’s going to take anywhere from a year to two years, you say you can do it so quickly?” He said, “Sir, we’re going to hit them from the front.

Donald Trump,"We’ve defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate, and no longer have any troops in the area. We don’t have any troops. The troops have been pulled out. Where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds, get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We got along with the Kurds, and we helped the Kurds. And don’t forget they’re also fighting for their land. You know that. But they’re fighting.",(01:31:41),minnesota rally

Donald Trump,"I told this story yesterday, I have to sign letters, it’s the hardest thing I have to do. I sign letters, “Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Somebody from some great state, I’m sorry to inform you, your son has been killed in combat. I’m so sorry.” And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, they’re grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I don’t want to see that it’s like the same letter. So we do different letters. It’s the hardest thing I have to do. Hardest thing.it’s the hardest thing I have … I was telling Tom Cotton, it’s the hardest thing that I have to do. And I sign those letters, and it just, it breaks your heart.",(01:32:45),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"And by the way, there’s a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But there’s a time, and there’s not necessarily a time. But I send these letters out, quite a few. And sometimes I send letters out, it’s called blue on green, where we’re teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back. And that’s the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know everyone. That’s the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died. When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot. We’ve had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we’ve ever had proportionately before. It’s a horrible, horrible thing. But I have to sign these letters.",(01:33:45),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"And sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force Base, it’s a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes. We go out there, and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers. We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible. I don’t know how parents can do it, even. And I’ll meet them. And we have a particular Colonel, that’s all he does. So good. So professional. That’s what he does. He said, “I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead.”",(01:34:27),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"And what happens is this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in so powerful, so big. I’ll be talking to some of the parents, and they’ll act like they’re fine. I said, “How are you doing?” “We’re fine, sir. We’re fine. We’re really good.” I say, “That’s great.” And I’ll tell the Colonel, I’ll say, “Colonel, I think they’re doing great.” “No sir, they’re not going to do great. You’ll see.” And I didn’t know what he was talking about, this is the first time.",(01:35:18),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this. That’s what they do. What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, “Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that you’ll never see. You will hear sounds like you’ve never heard.” That’s what he does.",(01:35:51),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane. And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you’ve never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, “Sir, you’ll see things that you’ve never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag.” I’ve seen this.",(01:36:25),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"Then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay. And I don’t want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We’ve now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time. We’re now going to be there for close to 19 years. It’s time to bring them home. It’s time to bring them home. It’s true. Time to bring them home. We’ve done our job, we’ve defeated everyone that we’re supposed to defeat. And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing. That’s what we’re doing. We’re policing. And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing. We’re not fighting, we’re policing. And you know what? After all of these years … One other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts. And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one … they’re just very, very devastated. But these are great, great people. And I gave out the Purple Heart. And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets’ care, and nobody’s done better. We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible.",(01:37:21),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts. And their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing. I said, “What’s your problem?” “Sir, my face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart.” He said, “Sir, it’s incredible.” And I looked at him, I said, “That’s the most beautiful nose I’ve ever seen. What do you mean?” He said, “A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments.” Now I don’t know if that’s right, but well, a lot. He meant a lot. “He said there were a thousand fragments. He rebuilt my nose with glue. He glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose.” I say, “You have the most beautiful nose I’ve ever seen,” and it’s true. And his father came over to me, he said, “Sir,” father was crying, he said, “Sir, honestly, my son looks better now.” He said, “My son did not have a good look. He knows. Now look at it, it’s beautiful, it’s beautiful.”",(01:39:26),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people. And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see, and there’s nobody like them. And I have to give a shout out to those people, there’s nobody like them. So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. No, you don’t want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially. Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that. You know? Let’s mediate a deal. But remember they’ve been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama. So we did our job. We knocked out.",(01:40:34),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"And I’ll tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We’re not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters. Most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany. They came from France. They came from all of these countries. And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, “Take your fighters.” They said, “We don’t want them. You take them.” I said, “No, no, no, we did you a big favor. They’re citizens of Germany. They’re citizens of France. They’re citizens of these various countries in Europe. Take your fighters.” “We don’t want them, sir. We don’t want them.’ And I said, “How unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor, and they won’t take the fighters.”",(01:41:39),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"So we’re doing some things that are pretty amazing. Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East. We’ve lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it’s less safe, it’s less stable, and it’s less secure. And I say it all the time. The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives. And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives. What did we do?",(01:42:23),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"So we’re going to pull them out, and we’re pulling people out, and we’re trying to make good deals, and we’re going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they’ll be ready. Previous administrations lust for regime change, and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures. The Christians, the Christians. And we work hard with the Christians. We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with the Christians.",(01:43:27),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"So we’re slowly getting out of the Middle East. We’re doing it carefully. And we’re rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” We had old planes. We had planes that were so old, they didn’t fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” Think of that. Think of that.",(01:44:13),minnesota rally
Donald Trump,"Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than we’ve ever had before.

And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open. And they understand that. And I don’t blame China for what’s taken place over the last 25 years.

It’s not China’s fault.",(01:46:18),minnesota rally

Tremendous jobs. And now the iron range is back in business. The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, “Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away.’ I’ll never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes.

The ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy. We are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence.

Since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs. We have created over 750,000 jobs right here in Texas and very importantly, that includes 70,000 new Texas manufacturing jobs. They said that couldn’t be done. Unemployment … Think of this. Unemployment in Texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, and unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number. Unemployment among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Over the last two years, the unemployment rate among Indian Americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent. Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many, many years. In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken home $1,000 extra in rising wages and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we’ve done. And for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women. First time that’s ever happened. Through our pledge to America’s workers, we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for American workers done through our great American companies. We passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country. We slashed a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household more than $3,000 every year and never in the history of our country, no matter how long the presidency, have regulations been cut to this extent. Everyday, the Indian American community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future. Indian Americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives. They’re developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and they’re founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens. Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before. And that’s what’s happening.

Nations around the world are investing in the United States because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world. They have never invested in our country like they are today.

That means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump. Yesterday, we were thrilled to hear about the Indian company Petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of LNG per year from the United States, which could lead to billions of dollars of LNG exports to India in the coming years. And we have plenty of it. Over the last year, crude exports to India have grown by 400% and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers. Thank you.

We stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Thank you. Both India and the United States also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders.

And out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers, because they were targeted by China, because China knows, very smart, that the farmers love Trump, and Trump loves the farmers. I said to our Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, “Sonny, how much did the farmers get hit by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things?” He said, “$16 billion.” I said, “That’s okay. We’ll take $16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number.

Now, if you don’t like your children, don’t do it. But when it’s your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard. You have great kids, you love your kids, they’re taking care of you. You really love them. It’s a great thing. If you don’t love them, don’t even listen to the last line, because it won’t matter. Don’t leave it to them. If they’re not good, leave it to charity. Leave it to something else. Don’t get it to them. I know a guy who can’t stand his children, they’re horrible, horrible human beings. They’re a little older now, but they’re horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. I said, “Why would you leave them? They don’t even like you.” But on the assumption that you love your children, you’ll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things. You’ll be able to leave them to your children. Your children won’t have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They won’t be losing it to the banks five years later. We got rid of it. That’s a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. For many decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests. You know that, in New Mexico, you know exactly what I’m talking about. People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control. Look at what’s going on now, how we’re doing. I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of Mexico. We have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country. And I’ll take it. Because our laws are so bad, they’re so pathetic. And the Democrats could change these laws. They could change them so quickly. We could change them all in less than an hour. We could, whether it’s asylum, whether it’s any of the laws, we have so many of them that are so bad. How they got that, it took years and years to end up.",(41:24),new mexico

And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people aren’t getting through.

Probably, I can say they’re coming back like never before. People are coming back now, because they want to be where the action is. And this is the country where they have the security, and where they do have the action. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration’s job-destroying… and this was a catastrophe. You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now New Mexico, you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA. Your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. This was one of the great catastrophes. And now we’re replacing NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA. Think of the song YMCA. YMCA. Think of the song. USMCA, that’s US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And it’s drawing strong Bipartisan support from all across your state, and all across the country. It’s amazing.

There’s never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we’ve been able to do or achieve. In a few short weeks, we’ll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges.

I don’t know what happened, but we started off with 138, now we’re up to 180. I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Great, great men. So think of that. You know, you come in, and I’ve always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but that’s okay. I disagree with a lot of things. Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right? But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite? We do better than they do, we’re smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite. That means you’re the super elite. I’ve always take offense when somebody said, “President Trump is tired of listening to the elite.” I said, “No, no, I’m more elite than them.” Right? I think so. I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president. And I’ll be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, it’s incredible. But it’s the greatest single decision I’ve ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly. I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through. Could not be happier. After years of building up other countries, we’re finally building up our country. Isn’t that nice?

So, what happens is on that beautiful election… Was that one of the greatest, coolest nights ever? Well, they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you’re winning by a lot. This is six months. “Texas is in play. You know, he could lose Texas.” I keep saying, I go to a stadium, we sell out to thousands of people, lines that are miles long. I mean, and every friend of mine says, “You’re going to win by a lot.”",(01:22:28),new mexico
Donald Trump,"So, they announce 8:00, whatever time, “The polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump has won this state of Texas. The polls in Utah are closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Utah.” They don’t even take a breath. Now, if it’s close like it’s in play, you wait two, three, four or five hours to see what it is, but they don’t even a breath because they’re called suppression poles and they’re no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see. They’re no different. They’re suppression polls, and I’ll tell you what. We’re going to win the state of New Mexico and I’ll be so surprised if we don’t. I’ll be so surprised.",(01:23:13),new mexico
Donald Trump,"No, we’re going to win New Mexico. You know, when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little, but I saw great spirit. But I didn’t really have a track record because I never did this stuff before. So, I said I was going to cut your taxes. I did. I said I was going to cut your regulations. I did more than any president in history and they’ve been there for many years. I’ve been there for two and a half. And I think the regulation cutting… Like the Waters of the US, that was another beauty where you couldn’t build a house, you couldn’t farm your land. Now, what we’ve done on regulations is incredible.",(01:24:26),new mexico
Donald Trump,"I’ve done… I’ve rebuilt our military, I’ve taken care of our vets. Look how happy our vets are with choice. Instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days, they now go out. If there’s a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor. They get taken care of. We pay the bill. And for the first time, they’ve tried to get that for 45 years, they haven’t been able to get it, but I’m good at getting things.",(01:25:04),new mexico
Donald Trump,"You must never forget. The 2020 election is about one thing. What’s it about? It’s about you. It is. It’s about you. It’s about you. I’m doing a good job as your messenger, but basically I’m a messenger. I know what you want. I understand that it’s about your family. It’s about your future, and it’s about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody. It’s about the fate of your country. It’s about the future of our great country.",(01:25:32),new mexico
Donald Trump,"No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. That’s what it’s about. Look at Venezuela. Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today, very sad. No food, no water, no nothing. Socialism. We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. And it’s not just a little bit positive. Our country is going to be greater than it ever was. That’s where we’re headed.",(01:26:09),new mexico
Donald Trump,"Together, we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and very lawful system of immigration. And we’re going to have a lot done anyway. We already do have a lot done. You saw the figures last week, but we’re doing it the hard way. It would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, that incredible phrase, “Made in the USA.” We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years, and we’ve already started that program. It will happen. We have the medicine. Nobody even knew that.",(01:26:59),new mexico
Donald Trump,"The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years. We’ve already started the process. It’s been funded. It’s been funded. Who would’ve thought that? Honestly, when I ran, I didn’t know that. We have now the technology and what they’ve done with respect to AIDS is incredible. What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within 10 years. We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs. Right? They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, okay?",(01:28:22),new mexico
Donald Trump,"I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, it’s considered a hazardous waste site. It’s all gases inside and you’re supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container. Give me a break. I asked the people, the professionals, “Well, what do people do when it breaks? Because they break all the time. What do they do?” Nothing, they throw it away. A lot of people didn’t know. They didn’t understand. You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it’s much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous. The gases come out, they’re dangerous. These are the little things that I have to explain. Otherwise, people will say, “What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for?”",(01:29:06),new mexico
Donald Trump,"And we’re trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline. They have so much junk that they’re less safe. So, what I want to do is the following. Under our rules and regulations, the cars are environmentally terrific, but they’re safer and they’re $3,500 less to buy, right? And the reason they’re safer is because they could be a little bit heavier. Makes sense, right? They could be a little bit heavier. I mean, they make them now like paper mache. Somebody touches them and the entire car collapses. When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible. No, they’re made out of paper mache. They weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus, it’s over. They say, “What happened to that car?” No, I think of it, it’s safer and it’s less expensive by $3,500 on average. And California wants you to do the other cars and we don’t. We’re going to end up in a big litigation and I’m fighting for you. Look. Look, it’s not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say, “Let them pay more. Let it be unsafe.” They listen to the environmentalists, and I’m an environmentalist. I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know, right now, we have the cleanest air that we’ve ever had in this country?",(01:30:05),new mexico
Donald Trump,"But what are they going to do about China and India and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff? What are we doing about them? We’re going to keep our nation clean. But you know, the universe is so big that when you talk about China, the USA, India, you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right? It’s so big that it’s right next to each other. It’s right next to each other. Does that make sense? Right? It’s right next to each other. So, what are they going to do? We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air. We will defend privacy. We will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always defend your second amendment and we’re doing it now. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.",(01:31:59),new mexico
Donald Trump,"We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that mothers and fathers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto. Nobody will ever take it down. Nobody will ever take it down. We will never allow them to take it down. In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it won’t even be close, and we’re right there. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world.

It’s two people tonight. Remember, when they say “Massive protest at the Trump rally,” two people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning in a win like never before. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God.

I think there’s only one way you can describe the last two years. It’s been two and a half years of action. It’s been two and a half years of results.

So, we’ve had great support over the last six months in particular from a man who happens to be your senator right now, and we need him to keep going, because he has been fantastic. And, I believe he’s here tonight. I just came in. The weather wasn’t so great to be traveling today, and they said, “Maybe we could skip North Carolina today, sir.” So, I said, “No, thank you.” I said, “No, thank you.” Can you imagine?",(44:38),north carolina

A man who’s really been stepping up to the front. He defended Justice Kavanaugh when he was treated so badly. I’ve never seen anything like the treatment that Justice Kavanaugh received.

Donald Trump,"For decades our leaders put global interest and special interest ahead of your interest. You know that better than anybody, and this state knows it better than anybody. They traded away your factories, sold your future, squandered your tax dollars, sacrificed your security, and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another. But all of that is changed. We’re respected again. They’re all saying, “Oh, gee. I hope he doesn’t do this or that.” They’ve taken advantage of us for years, and I have to say sadly, in many cases it’s our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country.",(57:13),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But now you finally have a president who understands that I’m not supposed to be the president of the world, I’m supposed to be the President of the United States of America.",(59:08),north carolina
Donald Trump,"To bring back our jobs for other countries, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We’ve cut a record number of job killing regulations. No president, no longer how long they serve, has gotten anywhere even close to what we’ve done with regulations, and that’s one of the reasons our economy is so good. And we have tremendous potential upward, and China wants to talk. They want to talk. China’s lost three million jobs, thousands of companies are leaving China, the supply chain is crumbling because they can’t pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you would’ve never thought. As an example, hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost, which the fake news doesn’t want to tell you.",(59:09),north carolina
Donald Trump,"And out of the tens of billions of dollars that we’ve taken in, because of the fact that our great American patriot farmers have been targeted by China, they’ve been targeted, because they know the farmer is like Trump. I love the farmers. So they targeted the farmers, and I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, “Sonny, how much was it, last year and the year before? Tell me.” It was $12 billion and it was $16 billion, and out of the tariffs that we’ve taken in, we gave to our farmers for distribution, hopefully very good distribution, hopefully very even distribution, we’ve given them $28 billion so that they’re whole. So that they’re whole. Nobody would ever do that. Nobody would ever do that, I can tell you that right now, and our farmers know we have to fight.",(59:09),north carolina
Donald Trump,"I see it all the time, where some of the networks that are crazy, they have a group of farmers, in some cases they have groups of women, they say, “What do you think of President Trump?” “We like him a lot. We’re with him all the way.” And they want to turn off the cameras. They go crazy, but with the farmers you know that. You ever see that? The 10 women. “What do you think of President Trump?” “We love him!” Boy would I like to put you on television, I’ll tell you right now, and they can’t turn off those cameras fast enough, but they say to the farmers, “You voted for President Trump, are you happy?” And ever one of them said, “He did things that no ones ever done before.” Who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 million, $28 billion, because they’ve been targeted. That’s the amount",(59:09),north carolina
Donald Trump,"I asked Sonny, I said Sonny, “What’s the amount they’ve took our of our farmers?” “It was 16 billion and the year before 12.” And said Sonny, “We got to make that up,” and we made that up. Who would do that? Nobody would do that. First of all, nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from China because it’s always been the other way around. China has taken advantage of our country for decades, decades. And I guarantee you one thing, none of these Democrats, whether it’s Pocahontas or Sleepy Joe, none of them would be able to do a thing about it, and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by China.",(59:09),north carolina
Donald Trump,"China made $500 billion over the last number of years, on a yearly basis, they steal our intellectual property. So many other things. So now it’s just different, and now it’s working the other way, and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them, they’re a beautiful thing. And I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they’ve had now the worst year in 57 years. I wonder why? I wonder why? And hopefully it’ll all work out. We’ll see. We’re going to be talking next week. We’re talking now. They’re going to be coming to the United States in two or three weeks, and we’ll see what happens, but unless we’re going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country, let’s face it, we can not go back to a situation. We’re giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China becomes standard fare. Not going to happen, we can’t do it, and we have many other countries also, but we’ll worry about them a little bit later.",(59:09),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Plenty of others, they’ve taken advantage of our country like you wouldn’t believe, and I’ve been saying this for many years. I was saying this when I was a private citizen. They take our jobs, they make our product, they sell the product into our country with no tax, no nothing. So we end up with closed factories, no jobs, no taxes, no nothing, and these other countries gain. As an example, Mexico, I must say they’ve really helped us at the border. The Democrats will not doing anything about these horrible open loopholes, which would be so good. So we’re doing it a different way, and Mexico is now patrolling with 27,000 troops. They’ve never had two troops steward our border, and you saw the numbers today were down approximately 57%. But our country could fix it so easy if the Democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes, but they don’t want to do that because they want to have open borders.",(59:09),north carolina

You have to have a wall and you have to stop it, and when you look at what’s happening with human trafficking, and it’s mostly women, they traffic in women and they pour through our borders. Well, every inch of wall that we put up is vital and we’re putting up miles and miles, and we intend by next year, at the end of the year, to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built, and this is serious wall.

What can be much more threatening that people that want to pour across our borders, and we have the worst walls, we have the weakest walls in the history of any country? You can’t do anything to stop them. You have program, catch and release. You catch them and then you have to release them, and they’re suppose to come back to court in the next three, four, fix, six years, and nobody shows up, and Democrats don’t want to fix it. So we’re stopping them, so we don’t even have to worry about court.",(59:10),north carolina

So they’re not exactly happy.",(59:11),north carolina

Yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy, and wage an under… If you look at what’s going on your way of life is under assault by these people. I mean, I go out and sometimes I’ll get these huge audiences, and I wish we could’ve gotten a large arena than this. We tried. I was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet, but they said it was a little bit out of your district, and I said, “I don’t know if it looks good being out of your district.” But I was willing to do it, I would’ve taken it. I would have been very proud to have done it. It would’ve shown it’s my real hair at least. It wouldn’t be pretty, but it’s my hair. May not be great, but I will say it’s better than most of my friends who are the same age. A lot better. A lot!",(01:00:08),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But we had a different location, as you all know, and we said, “Let’s do this one. It’s bigger.” And we put screens outside for all of the people.

Donald Trump,"The last administration, with Biden and Obama at the helm, they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals that ever been negotiated, the Transpacific Partnership. You could’ve kissed many of your industries goodbye. TPP would’ve gutted the American auto industry. It would’ve been even worse than NAFTA, and we know how bad NAFTA was. All you have to do, is even to this day, look around at all those empty plants where people moved down and companies moved down to Mexico. Not under the USMCA. We got to get Nancy Pelosi to put it in for a vote, make it bipartisan. She’ll have tremendous Democrat support. The farmers want it, the unions want it, the manufacturers want it, and by the way, 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country, remember? You would need a magic wand. You can’t do that anymore. Well, we did it, but we’ve got to get USMCA put up for a vote by the Democrats.",(01:00:22),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But in my first week in office I proudly withdrew from that job destroying TPP catastrophe, and we’re replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country. You can go back as far as you want, NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. So whatever you do, start talking to your people, we need a vote on the USMCA.

Last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years. At the center of the American drug crisis is the border crisis. Criminal cartel smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our souther border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl. 100,000 people a year die from what comes across our souther border, and we can get the Democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter.

Let me see. That guy would. Maybe him, maybe her, right? Maybe her. But it’s a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do. So dangerous.

As long as I’m your president I will never, ever let Democrats take away your healthcare, and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally. We can’t do that. It’s a tremendous incentive to come in. Democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas, all at the expense of supporting their own communities.

And they want to take away your private healthcare, your private insurance. 180 million people will lose with what they want to do. It’s a disaster. It’s like, did you ever really feel where you don’t even have to treat people nicely? You don’t have any choice, you have to vote for me. I can leave right now.

I never liked this guy, and I see him in the White House, and I say, “What are you doing here?” And he goes, “Mr. President.” See now he calls me Mr. President. He used to call me something else. “Mr. President, I’m fighting for your victory.” I said, “You got to be kidding.” He goes, “Honestly, you’re doing a great job, but also if this radical left gets in they’re going to take away everything, and they’re going to destroy our country.” And for the first time I like this guy.",(01:01:16),north carolina

It didn’t work out that way, did it? Obamacare, and we’re keeping Obamacare alive. We got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare. We’re keeping it and running it as well as it can, but the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof. It’s ridiculous, and we’re coming up with Lindsey Graham and all of the folks, we’re coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we take back to the house.

He was talking after the baby is born, the doctor will talk to the mother and they’ll make the decision as to whether or not that baby lives. This is a radical Democrat idea. That’s why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and socialism. They’re socialists. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream.

And I said, “Wait a minute, if a person is sick… ” And they’ve been trying to get this for 45 years. I said, “If a person is sick, and maybe terminally ill, why aren’t we letting them try this new technology?” And so many things are happening, and we did Right to Try.

I got it done. The results have been unbelievable. Right to Try. Things that we’ve never even talked about we’re getting done.

Donald Trump,"… people in the House of Representatives. And Kevin, I want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one. That was a great job, thank you, Kevin McCarthy. We’ve received record funding for the US military, 700 billion last year, 716 billion dollars this year, 738 billion dollars …",(01:25:31),north carolina
Donald Trump,"And you know, know I’m a big believer in budgets but we have no choice. We had to rebuild our military with all that’s going on today with China, with Russia, with radical Islam, with everything that’s happening, we had to do something. And you know, budgets are fine, I love budgets and we will get to that, don’t worry about it.",(01:27:18),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But we had to rebuild, our military was totally depleted, it was totally depleted. We have beautiful new F-35’s, F-18’s, new ships, new missiles, new rockets, we have new everything. I came back with Admiral Brown, the United States Coast Guard and some of the other folks, and they were saying that the new Coast Guard cutters …",(01:27:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"How good a job has the Coast Guard done during these hurricanes? And I said, “Admiral, how good are the new Coast Guard cutters?” He said, “They’re the finest in the world, sir.” And they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring. They have brand new Coast Guard cutters. We had to do it, we had to do it.",(01:27:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"There’s always time for the other but we had to do it. We’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve taken care of the great people that work in our military. We gave them a raise, a beautiful raise they were so entitled to. And I also got other NATO members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they weren’t paying, they were delinquent.",(01:27:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"We’re supposed to protect them and they don’t pay, I say you can’t do that. You can’t do that, you got to pay, NATO. Now we’re finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense, we’re negotiating with a lot of them. Think of it, we have these immensely wealthy countries and they’re paying for a fraction of our cost to defend them.",(01:27:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"How did that happen? And do you know what the biggest excuse is when I go to them and I’ll say, “King, you got to pay,” or, “Mr. Prime minister, you got to pay,” or, “Mr. President, you’ve got to pay,” you know? It’s costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy. You know what their biggest thing is?",(01:27:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Because I can’t understand how we did this for so many years, decades, decades … “You have been defending all of …” I won’t mention names because I don’t want to embarrass anybody. I don’t want to, forget it, some of the wealthiest countries in the world. And when I say, “King, President, Prime Minister, Queen,” no matter what I say, you know what they say?",(01:27:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"“But nobody’s ever asked us to do that before,” that’s the only excuse. Because I say to them, “Why would we do this? Why are we defending you? You’re immensely wealthy, you compete with us on trade.” We have lousy trade deals that we are renegotiating many of them and ultimately all of them. “Why are we protecting you, Mr. President?”",(01:27:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"“Well, I don’t know, I don’t know.” But you know what their answer is? “Because you’ve always done it.” That’s not a great answer. So we’re taking in billions and billions but I’ve got 100 billion dollars and the Secretary General of NATO, Stoltenberg, is my biggest fan. He said, “Until President Trump, you had to see the data across the spending was going like this.”",(01:28:14),north carolina
Donald Trump,"And ours was going like this, we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly. We were defending them and now it’s changing, around 100 billion dollars, they’re not happy. And then I read where Obama is more popular in Germany than Trump. He’s got to be, I’m making people pay their bills, he’s got to be.",(01:28:16),north carolina
Donald Trump,"You know, the day that I’m more popular than him, I’m not doing my job. The big story, they like him more in Europe than they like Trump. I think they should. 100 billion dollars more they’re paying. To protect America’s security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. We paid them 150 billion dollars for that piece of work.",(01:29:39),north carolina
Donald Trump,"I withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they’re a much different country and let’s see what happens. But I can tell you they’d like to get back to business because they’re not doing very well. When I came into office, Iran was a real terror. 18 sites of confliction, they were behind every one of them in the Middle East.",(01:29:39),north carolina
Donald Trump,"And who knows, could have been elsewhere. And I said we’re not going to do it, 150 billion dollars President Obama paid and 1.8 billion in cash. Whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion? In hundred dollar bills, it’s a lot. Now take a million dollars and make it 1.8 billion dollars in cash. I’m actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars, you want to know the truth.",(01:29:39),north carolina
Donald Trump,"1.8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so I terminated the deal. And I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem which every president said they would do. And I also approved for Israel the Golan Heights and if you really think about it, I said to people, “What’s more important, the Golan Heights or the capital of Jerusalem by moving our embassy there?”",(01:34:19),north carolina
Donald Trump,"He said, “Neither, sir. What you’ve done in Iran is more important than both of them.” I said, “You know, I guess you’re right when you think about it.” So we’ve done a good job, all of us together, as a movement we’ve done a great job for Israel. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina.",(01:34:20),north carolina
Donald Trump,"You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing thing, you. It’s true, it’s not about me, it’s about you. It’s about your family, your future and the fate of your country. That’s what we did in 2016, they came from the hills and valleys, they came from the cities, they came from all over the place and people were saying, these fakers back there, they were saying, “What the hell is happening?”",(01:34:20),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But I knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies, the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever, ever, ever in politics, ever in politics. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and a destruction of the American dream.",(01:34:20),north carolina
Donald Trump,"We are entering this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of North Carolina. And I’ve said it and I say it loudly and proudly, I don’t believe there’s been any president or any administration that has done more in 2.5 years then we have as a group in America. When you add it all up, nobody’s done what we have.",(01:34:20),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Our first task is a giant victory. Tomorrow, right here in the great state of North Carolina with your support, tomorrow we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020. We need everybody to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote for Dan Bishop and get out and vote for Greg Murphy, you got to get out tomorrow and vote.",(01:34:20),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Together we will lift millions more from our horrible, horrible situations that have developed over the years. Look at what’s happening to Democrat-run cities, every single one of them. We are going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will elect for Republicans to Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration.",(01:34:20),north carolina
Donald Trump,"We will enact great deals that result in more products probably stamped with the four beautiful words made in the USA, made in the USA. You want made in America, I don’t care, what do you like better? Made in america or made in the USA? Go ahead. Wait, ready? You want made in America then made in the USA. What do you like better, made in America, made in the USA? Okay, I think we know that answer.",(01:34:26),north carolina
Donald Trump,"So in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics, make America great again. Now we are within moments hopefully of having, despite what you heard a few weeks ago, where we were heading. And they’re going, “Please, please let there be a recession, please.” They’re willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election. They’re not going to win the election.",(01:34:36),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Don’t forget, we are doing this and still fighting the unfairness of China and other countries on trade. What happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed? We’re setting new records and we’re fighting trade deals and we’re fighting military deals that are unfair to our country. Think what happens when it all gets fixed, We have ourselves a country that’s going to be so strong. But we had a phrase, make what? Make America great again, the best.",(01:34:36),north carolina
Donald Trump,"I think it was maybe the greatest, 2016, but we’ve done a lot and now they’re very close to setting a new … I think it’s the 118th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market, right? Many, many times, many, many times. I can’t be certain that many but it’s a lot, okay? I always have to preface it because there’ll be headlines, Trump didn’t tell the truth. So I’ve always got to be extremely cautious.",(01:34:36),north carolina
Donald Trump,"We had the greatest phrase of all time and even the fake news media would agree, make America great again, MAGA country, make America great again. Now we still have a year and a half, little bit less, can you believe it? Can you believe it? I stood in the White House with the first lady that first night and I said, “Wow, look at this. That’s the bedroom of Abraham Lincoln,” you have to see this. It’s so perfectly done, it’s so the way it was.",(01:34:42),north carolina
Donald Trump,"That’s the bedroom of the great Abe Lincoln. “Honey, can you believe this?” That was the first night and now in less than a year and a half, the first term will be over. Think of that. I announced today that we got the soccer World Cup, that’s a big thing, who else was going to do it? But we’ve got a problem, it’s in 2026 [inaudible 01:38:17]. We announced it in front of the press and in 2026.",(01:38:00),north carolina
Donald Trump,"And I said, “Well, wait a minute, under the normal rules I will be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term.” Oh, they’re going crazy. Tomorrow, you will see headlines, Trump wants an extra term, I told you, I told you. He wants an extra term, ladies and gentlemen. We told you, we told you he’s a dictator, we told you. No, no, I’m only kidding, I’m only kidding.",(01:38:17),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But we actually have the World Cup, it’s the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it. And that’s where we’re working it also with Mexico and Canada to give them some of the games. We’ve got a great relationship with the World Cup, it’s a big deal. Bob Kraft helped me with the New England Patriots people. Tom Brady had a pretty good game the other night, right? They have a good a coach, whether you like it or not, and I know you, North Carolina.",(01:38:17),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But how good a coach, in all fairness here, is Coach Belichick? How good is he? I know you want to be cool but he’s pretty good. We have to appreciate genius, we all like genius. But we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science, medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the AIDS epidemic in America. That’s shocking to hear that but we can do it, we’re going to do it, definitely.",(01:38:23),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Incredible, the strides that we have made. We will defeat the Democrats to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare and education by liberating Americans from their analysts’ push for a job killing, soul crushing Washington regulations. As an example, we’re trying to get the car companies, going to give them a little bit of extra energy and they will be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today.",(01:40:33),north carolina
Donald Trump,"And you’ll save 3,500 dollars, think of that. It will be safer, it will be better, you can save 3,500 dollars, it will be less costly. And we’re going to try to get that done. And then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune, so I signed something a couple days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light bulbs, I don’t know about you, much less expensive.",(01:40:39),north carolina
Donald Trump,"I don’t know about you but … I don’t know, I’m not a vain person. And I know I have real vain people, especially these incredibly ladies in the front, but I look better under an incandescent light than these [inaudible 01:40:45] lights that are beaming down over us. But you know, somebody told me that as you know, they’re much more expensive bulbs than for what you save.",(01:40:45),north carolina
Donald Trump,"But they said that if the bulb break, it’s considered almost like the waste site. It’s very big, the bulbs, the new bulbs, they’re very dangerous with all of the gases. And I said, “What’s the point?” Well, then he said, “Well, I’m saying if we continue that production, they can buy whatever they want to buy but it can really save a tremendous amount of money and even have a light that’s better.”",(01:40:45),north carolina
Donald Trump,"And there is a big danger, in fact they have labels, don’t break this bulb. What do you do, you’re going to throw it away? I promise I won’t break it, all the new ones. So you can hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you could even look better. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms.",(01:41:49),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America, we’ll be one united nation. We’ll support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement, thank you, law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way like you.",(01:42:14),north carolina
Donald Trump,"We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust, it’ll stay there. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world.",(01:42:14),north carolina
Donald Trump,"We are great Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to you. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and I’d like to fight a little less with these people but they just don’t stop. They just keep coming at you in waves. They are unfortunately not the best people. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we’re going to keep on winning.",(01:42:14),north carolina
Donald Trump,"We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, we may have right now the greatest economy in the history of our nation. And ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again, we will. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you.",(01:42:14),north carolina
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Wow. I will never, ever let you down, that I can tell you. Amazing. And I want to thank Manchester and New Hampshire, they’re very special. You remember those primaries? That primary came around and remember what happened during the primary? Trump should come in third or fourth, and we came in easily number one, and that was the beginning. That was an easy one. I want to thank you all. This is incredible and it’s great to be back in a state that I love with thousands of hardworking Patriots, who are the heart and soul of America. And that’s what you are.",(04:55),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"We’re actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of New Hampshire in 2020. And I saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media, and it said that I’m tied with three of the other candidates, the Democrats, I’m tied in New Hampshire. I don’t think so. One of them has a rally, he’s got 100 people. So this holds 12,000 we’re full. And we could fill it up four times at least. We could fill it up four times. But I just want to thank you all. I just think it’s going to be a tremendous four years. We’re going to have a tremendous four years. Can you believe it? We only have a little more than a year to go, where it all started, right? The greatest political movement in the history of our country.",(05:53),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"And even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through, we have taken this big beautiful ship, and it’s being turned around very quickly. Three years ago, we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make America great again. And that’s exactly what we’ve done. I think we can honestly say it’s the greatest slogan in the history of politics in America. Make America great again. So if you don’t mind, the other candidates go, they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that I’m going to ask you. They spend millions. You remember the first slogan from our opponent? That’s right, neither do I. Neither does anybody. Nobody remembers. The only thing I remember is the first night I went out after I heard it and I said, see, it’s all about her. And they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars. It’s all about her. That didn’t work out too well. That slogan wasn’t too good. So we have to do this. We have to make a decision.",(07:08),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"Do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country? Make America great again, right? Do we give up make America great again for a new slogan, because look, our country is doing great. We are doing very well with China despite the fact that they want to have you believe in the contrary. All you have to do is say China, how you doing? They’re not too happy, they’re not too happy. They’re losing millions of jobs. The tariffs are working, and they’re eating the tariffs by the way. There’s no price increase. You know, you gotta talk to these people. The fake news. But do we give up?",(08:44),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"And by the way, the biggest beneficiary, you know who have been great? Our great farmers have been so incredible because they’ve been targeted by China, and frankly they’ve been targeted for a long time, including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time. So we’re making up for a lot of lost ground. But do we give up make America great for keep America great? Keep America great. Okay, you ready? Ready? I love this because it’s free. And we have all the time in the world, right? Is there anything better than a Trump rally? What about a sleepy Joe Biden rally? Well, he’s made some beauties. I sort of hope it’s him. I don’t mind any of them. You got Pocahontas is rising. We got Kamala. Kamala is falling. You got Beto. Beto is like gone. All right, we’ll see what happens. Whoever it is, I don’t know that it matters, but whoever it is different, different people. But I don’t know, I think sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line.",(09:36),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"But today they announced that they’re going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster, they’re going to have fewer appearances. You’ve heard that, right? They’re going to cut way back on his appearances. Can you believe it? If I ever did that, it would be over. The fake news would get us, but we don’t let them get us and it is fake. And today the deputy editor of the New York times was demoted. Isn’t that beautiful? All the news that is not fit to print. All the news, the fake failing New York Times. It’s really we, it’s not me. We’re doing it together. They came from the Hills, they came from the mountains, from the rivers, they came from all over the place. And they showed up and they voted like nobody’s seen before. And it was 306 to 223, remember? 306.",(11:58),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"And we won Wisconsin and they said, “Oh, we never thought of that.” Got to think about those things. And we won Michigan. And now we have a lot of car companies coming into Michigan, and we have a lot of great farming events happening, really big in Wisconsin. And we have incredible things going on in Pennsylvania. We just opened up a $10 billion plant. We have many of them going up. Many of them, a lot of jobs. In Louisiana, an LNG plant $10 billion. Could never have happened, could never have happened. Pennsylvania would have never happened. They wouldn’t have allowed him to frack. So they would’ve never been able to build it. But what a place that is, it will be open in a little more than a year, but I have to make a decision. It’s a big decision. Do we give up the greatest theme, phrase, logo, whatever you want to call it, in the history of politics, risky, for a brand new one because make America great again. We’re really sort of there, and we have a little time left. And now we have a group of socialists or communists, could be. They’re not far away. The fake news will hit me on that. How dare he say that? But they’re not far away, right? They’re not far away. 95%. Does anybody want to pay 95% taxes? I don’t think so. But I’m not going to go into their plan because as far as I’m concerned, the green new deal is a beautiful thing. No, it’s a beautiful thing. We want it to continue onward until about a month before the election. I will let them have it like you’ve never heard before. I don’t want it to change. Too early.",(13:08),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"It’s like Elizabeth Warren. I did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago. I should’ve waited. But don’t worry. We will revive it. It can be revived. It can be rewritten, right? It will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly. And we’re going to have some fun in the state of New Hampshire. Now what do we do, ready? Let me have first make America great again, then keep America great, right? Just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign. And there’s a possibility we’ll use both. There’s a possibility we’ll use both ’cause I hate like hell to give up the one. Is it a possibility we’ll use both? Maybe one a little bit less. Are you ready? So we’ll start make America great again, and then keep America. Are you ready? Who’s in favor of the campaign theme being make America great again?",(15:26),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"Who’s in favor of our theme being keep America great? Oh, wait a minute. This is your hat. I was going to keep it actually. Thank you. So that’s really been the reaction. I’ve done this before. Big crowds, and it really is keep America great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us. They want to take it away. Because until a couple of days ago, and that’ll catch up very quickly, we have no choice. By the way, I never said China was going to be easy, but it’s not tough and they want to make a deal. We just spoke to them yesterday. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. They have to make a deal.",(16:53),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"And you know what? It’d be wonderful to make a deal. I don’t think we’re ready to make a deal. We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. And again, China’s devaluing their currency. They’re pouring out money, the prices haven’t gone up. So that means we’re taking in billions of dollars. We’re not paying for it. And ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly. They want to make a deal, and they should want to make a deal. But when you listen to the fake news, look at how many there are. I mean, I actually had something today. I had something today. Are we sure that we’re in New Hampshire? You know, you have a reputation. I mean, I know it’s not true ’cause I know you too well. You have a reputation of being very stayed, very, very elegant, stayed, incredible people. You’re not acting it tonight, and that’s good. That’s a good thing.",(18:19),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"Wow. We love our country. We have enthusiasm for our country. That’s what it is. Before the election, our factories were closing. Hey, who knows it better than you? You’re like central casting for the closing of factories. Our jobs were vanishing. Our military was totally depleted. When I took over, our military was sad. We weren’t flying half of our planes, they were old. They were tired. Our equipment was tired. Our people weren’t tired, though. Our people weren’t tired. But everything we had, it was depleted. Now we’ve rebuilt our military like never before. And all made in the USA, just so you know. And our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad. They don’t disrespect us anymore, folks.",(19:57),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"I got NATO to pay an extra hundred billion dollars. They weren’t paying. They were delinquent. Many nations were, except for seven. Many nations weren’t paying what they were supposed to be paying, so we’re supposed to protect them. They kill us on trade. They have all sorts of barriers and everything else. The taxes are really unfair. The tariffs were ridiculous, what they do to us in Europe. And then we protect them. Then they don’t pay, and I say, “I’m sorry folks, you have to pay. You have to pay.” They were delinquent, they were delinquent. And my biggest fan is secretary General Stoltenberg from NATO. He said until president Trump came along, we were going, boom. They would’ve been finished very quickly, but I’m tired of paying for other nations anyway, I have to be honest with you.",(21:07),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"Today, our nation is stronger than ever before. We’re now stronger than ever before. You saw we ended the Iran disaster. How about that? We paid them a $150 billion. $1.8 billion in cash. Cash, cash, cash. We got nothing. And they also want to make a deal. China wants to make a deal, and I will tell you Iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them. They are not happy. So we’ll see how it all turns out. But it’s in good hands. It’s in good hands. The United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world. We’re rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about. Our United States armed forces. America is working again. America is winning again, and America is respected again, respected like never before. They respect us again, and you see it. You know, a recent poll came out where it showed that president Obama was more popular in Germany and other places than I am.",(22:08),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"And I said, of course he’s more popular. He’s not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide. He’s not doing that. I’m doing that. And in fact, if I was the most popular, I’m not doing my job right. So true. We’ve created over six million new jobs since the election. If I would have said that during the campaign, those people back there would have been headlines, headlines. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Since my election, the number of new businesses starting in the great state of New Hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25%.",(23:42),new hampshire
Donald Trump,"And you can’t really go by my election. You gotta go by November 9th because the markets have gone through the roof since November 9th. That’s the day after I won the election. So I won the election. The markets went up thousands of points. Things started happening. You started doing things that you would’ve never. Even though I didn’t get sworn in until January 20th, but they refused to do that. And let me tell you, if for some reason I wouldn’t have won the election, these markets would have crashed. That’ll happen even more so in 2020. See the bottom line is I know you like me and this room is a love fest, I know that. But you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes. Everything’s going to be down the tubes, so whether you love me or hate me, you got to vote for me. I had a businessman the other day, one of the most successful guys in the country.

Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county. Wages are rising quickly. Remember when I used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago? I used to say it all the time. Now I can say for the first time in 20 years, wages are rising, and you know who’s the biggest beneficiary? Blue collar workers. My administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race, religion, color, and creed. Very important. Because we are all Americans. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. We all share the same dreams. We are all children of the same Almighty God. But at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings, the radical Democrats are trying to tear America apart. They vilify anyone who doesn’t share their extreme views. They slander our law enforcement heroes. You see what they’re doing with our police that we love. You see what they’re doing.

In fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason, they named me Man of the Year in Michigan. I said, “How come?” I didn’t even understand it myself, but I was named Man of the Year. I wasn’t even political. That was years before I did this. But I was always complaining that our car business is being stolen. I mean, it’s sort of obvious, right? Mexico now has 32% of our car business. It all left the state of Michigan.

Look at this.” The opponent went there with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and she went there much earlier. Prime time, one o’clock, two o’clock in the morning is not exactly prime time. We had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd, and I looked at my people and I said, “I know we’re not supposed to win the great state of Michigan, but I think we’re going to win Michigan” and we won Michigan and we won Wisconsin. We won Wisconsin. Wisconsin was a great victory, and we won Pennsylvania, and we won North Carolina and South Carolina, and we won Florida, and I hate to tell you we should’ve won New Hampshire.

You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they’re getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration’s worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry.

But under the new… It’s going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax.

They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn’t want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it.

A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community.

It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let’s let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We’ll pay the bill.

I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn’t fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough.

Omar minimized the September 11th attacks on our homeland, saying some people did something. I don’t think so. Some people did something. Yeah, some people did something. All right. She pleaded for compassion for Isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization.",(20:53),maga event

You say, Al-Qaeda makes you proud. Al-Qaeda makes you proud. You don’t speak that way about America. And at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported Al-Qaeda, that’s our enemy. That’s our enemy. They are a very serious problem that we take care of, but they always seem to come along somewhere. She refused to answer. She didn’t want to give an answer to that question. Omar blamed the United States for the crisis in Venezuela.",(21:52),maga event

She was describing the President of the United States and the presidency with the big fat vicious, the way she said it, vicious F-word. That’s not somebody that loves our country. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Check out her scores by the way, with her green new deal, the green new deal. Where did that come from? She’s conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement, she compared American border agents managing a humanitarian crisis, that I always said was a humanitarian crisis, and they said it was manufactured.",(24:16),maga event

Takes too much time. So Cortez also, she said essentially Nazis are running concentration camps, and when Mike Pence went down just a few days ago with members of Congress and the media, and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps, they said, “Wow, these places a clean. Wow. They have air conditioning, they have water.”",(25:30),maga event

My generals did a great job, I flew there, I flew to Iraq, remember? I’m an Air Force One and they notified me, “Sir, we’re 45 minutes out, sir. We have to close all windows, we have to turn off all lights in the plane, sir. All windows, all lights have to be off, sir. We’re turning off the lights outside and the runway light, sir. They going to be in a very dim”… Frankly, if you’re not at 30-year old pilot you can’t see them, because I went there, I said, “I don’t see any light pilot.” As we’re landing, I said, “I don’t see.”",(01:22:43),maga event

So we land in this big, beautiful Air Force One and I’m saying, “Major, I don’t see a runway.” Yes sir, it’s right up ahead, the guy’s 30 years old or something. They’ll get me that, they’ll say majors aren’t 30, maybe he’s 35 whatever he is. They’re saying, “Yes sir, it’s right there.”",(01:23:26),maga event
Donald Trump,"I don’t see it major, how about lifting up, let’s go around. That’s the last thing we want to do in that part of the world. He said, “Sir, it’s right there, sir.” And we’re landing and I still haven’t seen a light. But these guys, we have the greatest pilots in the world, we have the greatest military in the world, we have the greatest equipment in the world.

Anguilla you got to pay your bills, you’re way behind.” So I would think that they should, they should all like… When you hear they like me better, I’m not doing my job.
