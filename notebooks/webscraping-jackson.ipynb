I will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasn’t in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning.

We have lost our standing in the region, we have lost the support of our allies. The next President has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.\n",

Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm’s way, often on deployment after deployment, then we’ve got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am President, anytime, which I hope will never happen, but anytime I’m compelled to use force, I seek that authorization.

But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let’s face it, Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we’ve had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran. Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us, putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. That to me is called strategy, having a goal to make America safer by looking more broadly than just us as the policemen of the world-\n",

Then a few months ago, you said, “No, you’re going to wait a while to get there.” And I think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what we’re talking about is true. And I don’t buy that it’s not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 a year that, “Your premiums will be cut in half.” Which is what the nonprofit public option will do. And if you talk, mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 co-sponsors. As president, I can get it done. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can’t negotiate for better prices for our seniors. I will it done.\n",

There are two problems. We’re spending way too much because corporations own the system, and we’re not negotiating against those corporations and we’ve given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That’s all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering. Senator Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we’re going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That’s why I’m for term limits.

Tiffany from Clive writes, “As a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two thirds of my income. Many families don’t have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed. That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly as we’ve seen in Iowa over the last few years. How will you prioritize accessing quality affordable childcare in your first 100 days in office?”\n",

But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that they’re working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense and it must change and we shouldn’t be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality. Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large. We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody’s like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.\n",

We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.

In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical. This is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes to adapt, to make sure our communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other. But we also have to ensure that we don’t allow this to get any worse. And if we get it right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them. Whether we’re talking about farmers, or industrial workers in my community, and make clear that we need to enlist them-\n",

He’s already told Americans last month in Florida, you don’t like me and I don’t like you, but you’re all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control. So let’s be clear, I started a business by myself in one room. I didn’t inherit a penny from my parents. I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power. But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and I have the experience and the expertise to show that he’s a [inaudible 01:50:58] and a fraud. Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey. I have 30 years of international business experience, I can beat Trump on the economy.

The bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love and as far as I’m concerned, the American people are my teammates. And if there’s one thing I will not permit, it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face. And that is exactly what I’ve seen over the last seven years traveling around this country, seeing these Republicans led by Mr. Trump, basically kicking the American people in the face. I am prepared to take on Mr. Trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy. But I am asking for your support because I know that if I’m going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world.\n",

How children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink. How trans women, particularly trans women of color are at risk. Black infant mortality, climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities. People who are being crushed by student loan debt, farmers who are barely holding on, people struggling with mental illness. And yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and it’s filled with hope because I see this as our moment in history, our moment when no one is left on the sidelines.

How does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92%, half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight? How does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all. How does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional, a criminal justice system which is broken and racist, an immigration system that needs reform.

A quick reminder of the rules for this debate – each candidate has one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions from the moderators, and 45 seconds to answer rebuttal and follow-up questions.

Last night at this hour, the House of Representatives voted for only the third time in American history to impeach a president. Every one of you was in favor of this action. But unlike 1974 and President Nixon, congressional Democrats have so far not convinced a strong majority of Americans to support impeachment of President Trump.

Is any wonder that if you look at the international polling that’s been done that the Chinese leader is rated above American, the American president. Or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, “Stand fast,” and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him. We need to restore the integrity of the presidency, of the office of the presidency. And it’s about time we get that underway. My job, and I think the job of all of us up here, is to, in fact, well that’s not true, some are going to be actually voting in the Senate. But my job is to just go out and make the case why he doesn’t deserve to be president of United States for another four years.</p>,\n",

We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is, yeah, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand, is that we cannot have a president with that temperament, who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States.</p>,\n",

Last night, the president was impeached, and everyone now in the Senate who’s taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution, and that doesn’t mean loyalty to an individual, it doesn’t mean loyalty to a political party, it means loyalty to our country, and that vote will play out over the next several weeks. But the way I see this is we’ve now seen the impact of corruption, and that’s what’s clearly on the stage in 2020, is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history. This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else. That’s why I’m in this race.</p>,\n",

As a wise judge said, “The president is not king in America; the law is king.” And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention, and by the way I think he’s a pretty good size for a president, he was five foot four. And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent.</p>,\n",

Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney, who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said, “Okay, we’re going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.” We should hear from Bolden, who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president. That is the case. If President Trump thinks that he should not be impeached, he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses.</p>,\n",

Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history, it’s not a question of political expediency, it’s not a question of political tactics, it’s a question of right and wrong.

We’re getting our news from different sources, and it’s making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts. Congressional approval rating, last I checked, it was something like 17 percent, and Americans don’t trust the media networks to tell them the truth. The media networks didn’t do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place.

What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be, and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place.

Let’s turn now to an issue that is on the minds of all Americans, and that is the economy. Senator Sanders, today, the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It was supported by union-friendly leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and big labor groups like the AFL-CIO. They say it is going to be a big job creator. Senator, my question is, will you support this deal, and if not, why not?</p>,\n",

Now, I don’t agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word “climate change,” to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements.</p>,\n",

I’ll go with my friend Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement that’s come in front of him, and he’s voting for this, and I am too. And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but we’ve got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also oppose.</p>,\n",

It is equality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people. I think this agreement, while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it, is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest, and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal.</p>,\n",

The unemployment rate is at historic lows, unemployment among African Americans is down, the markets are booming, wages, while not growing as much as many would like, they’re still doing about as well as they were in the Obama/Biden era. My question to you, Mr. Vice President is, what is your argument to the voter watching this debate tonight, who may not like everything President Trump does, but they really like this economy and they don’t know why they should make a change?</p>,\n",

Go back and talk to the old neighbors in the middle class neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that. You have, for example, farmers in the Midwest, 40 percent of them could pay, couldn’t pay their bills last year.

That’s not being done, and the idea that we’re growing, we’re not growing. The wealthy, very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing.

It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years, because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history. The fact is, this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people’s lived experience on the ground.

Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart. Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us, who see climate change bearing down upon us.

Let’s start with a wealth tax. The idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country, 50 million dollars and above. For two cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal childcare, early childhood education for every baby in this country, age zero to five. Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old and raise the wage.</p>,\n",

We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates, we can cancel student loan debt, but think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires. They’re not eating more pizzas, they’re not buying more cars. We invest that 2% in early childhood education and childcare. That means those babies get top notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs, harder jobs, longer hours. We can increase productivity in this country and we can start building this economy from the ground up. That’s how we built it in small towns, that’s how we built it in rural America and that’s how we built it in urban America. An economy that works.</p>,\n",

And in addition, I’ve talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income, which would allow us to cut taxes for 95% of Americans by 10%.

My experience building a business, understanding how to make that happen means I can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure.

You either have to go all the way to the extreme or it’s business as usual. Yes, we must deliver big ideas and yes, taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up. We can also be smart about the promises we’re making. Make sure they’re promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy. It’s why, for example, I propose that we make college free for 80% of Americans, but it doesn’t have to be free for the top. If you’re in that top 10% how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on, that would make a big difference. Whether it’s infrastructure, childcare, housing, health. On issue after issue, we’ve got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize.</p>,\n",

Candidates, good evening. We’re going to talk about climate now. Senator Klobuchar, many scientists say that even if the US reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year 2050 the damage will have been done. The climate change will have made certain places in the US unlivable. So knowing this, would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of American families and businesses away from places like Miami or Paradise, California, perhaps. Davenport, Iowa. Because we know these places are going to be hit time and time again.</p>,\n",

And the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had. You saw it in Northern California as was mentioned with Paradise and the most moving video from that to me was a 30 second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down.</p>,\n",

So what I think we need to do get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules on day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California who has been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration. And then introduced sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century, which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards.</p>,\n",

Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we don’t declare a state of emergency on day one, I don’t understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead. Look, this is a generational question. I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage. I know everybody is worried about this, but for instance, I would call on Mayor Buttigieg to prioritize this higher.

We’d like to switch gears slightly. Vice president Biden, I’d like to ask you, three consecutive American presidents have enjoyed stints of explosive economic growth due to a boom in oil and natural gas production. As president, would you be willing to sacrifice some of that growth even knowing potentially that it could displace thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers in the interest of transitioning to that greener economy?</p>,\n",

The answer’s yes, because the opportunity for those workers to transition to high paying jobs, as Tom said, is real. We’re the only country in the world’s ever taken great, great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities. I’ve met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesn’t leak energy. That in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where there’s all kinds of folks out here, right here in California. We’re now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. We have enormous opportunities. For example, you talk about would we relocate people who in fact we’re in a position where they lost their home.</p>,\n",

We have to rebuild the standard that exists today. For example, we shouldn’t build another new highway in America that doesn’t have charging stations on it. We have an opportunity to put 550,000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market. There’s so many things we can do and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced, that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities.</p>,\n",

It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You’re talking about the Paris Agreement, that’s fine. Ain’t enough. We have got to, and I’ve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world. Instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.</p>,\n",

Senator Warren, a new question to you, Senator Warren. Many of our Western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because it’s efficient, affordable, and virtually carbon free. And many climate experts believe that it’s impossible to realize your goal of net zero emissions by the year 2050 without utilizing nuclear energy. So can you have it both ways on this issue?</p>,\n",

We’ve got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water and that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place. I will not build more nuclear. I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best. And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader. But understand the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in Washington who keeps saying the right thing, but continue to take money from the oil industry. Continue to bow down to the lobbyist, to the lawyers, to the think tanks to the bought and paid for experts.</p>,\n",

And if we don’t attack the corruption first, if we don’t attack the corruption head on, then we’re not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate, on gun safety, on drug pricing, on all of the big problems that face us.

So the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes, talking about what’s happening on the coast is I just did, but also talking about what’s happening in the Midwest, where I’m from. It’s not fly over country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We’re seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills. When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes, you win big, and I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket who’s from the Midwest.</p>,\n",

We’re already doing it. We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose. And we know that town is not alone. That’s playing out in coastal areas around the country. The question is, do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say, “We need to protect our people from climate change?” Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground. Because that’s what we need to do and that’s literal and figurative. Here in California, it’s forest fires and forest management. And nuclear power, I agree with the research.

It has a lot of risks to it in terms of disasters and we have no ability to store the toxins that come out of it and last a hundred thousand years. We actually have the technology that we need. It’s called wind and solar and batteries. So in fact, what we need to do, we can do. We’ve got to stop taking a look at this as something that we can’t do because we can do this, and we can do it in a way that rebuilds this country on an accelerated basis.

And by the way, we have an obligation up here if there are not any of our African American brothers and sisters up here, to speak about an economy in which African Americans are exploited, where black women die three times at higher rates than white women, where we have a criminal justice system which is racist and broken, disproportionately made up of African Americans and Latinos and Native Americans who are in jail.

I would pass, as president, my bill to register every kid in this country when they turn 18 to vote. That would make all of these discriminatory actions in these states go away and I would stop the gerrymandering, in addition to the agenda of economic opportunity.

And whether… In my view. We must understand that right now in Israel we have leadership under Netanyahu, who has recently, as you know, been indicted for bribery. Who in my view is a racist. What we need is a level playing field in terms of the Middle East, which addresses the terrible crisis in Gaza, where 60 or 70% of the young people are unemployed. So what my foreign policy will be about is human rights, is democracy, is bringing people together in a peaceful way, trying to negotiate agreements, not endless wars with trillions of dollars of expenses.</p>,\n",

The US clearly wants China’s cooperation on human rights, on climate change, on North Korea, on terrorism, and yet Americans are appalled by China’s record on human rights, including the detention of over a million Muslim Uyghurs.

Look, for the president to let it be known that his silence, whether it’s on the rounding up of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, putting them into camps, or the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for democracy. For him to let China know that his silence can be purchased is trashing American values. The reality is that there’s a lot more to the relationship with China than who’s selling more dishwashers?

Freedom of the press, not just here at home but around the world, gets weaker.

I just want to make very clear, Mayor, that the freedom of the press is deep in my heart. My dad was a newspaper man. And I am the one that asked every attorney general candidate we’ve had under Donald Trump, both of whom I opposed, about their respect for the First Amendment. And they have refused to follow the rules that Attorney General Holder put in place when it came to protecting our journalists. They would not commit that they wouldn’t put a journalist in jail for doing their job. So this is not just talking points to me, this is the real world.

I think I disagree with him on this one. Maybe a little self-serving, but I do disagree. Here is the issue. The issue is where power resides in America and it’s not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy, where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians. You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. We are the only major country on earth, not to guarantee healthcare for all people, which is why we need Medicare for all. We are facing an existential crisis of climate change. The issue is not old or young, male or female. The issue is working people standing up, taking on the billionaire class, and creating a government and an economy that works for all, not just the 1%.</p>,\n",

First of all, we have not had enough women in our government. When I was on Trevor Noah’s show once, I explained how in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2000 men and only 50 women in the whole history and he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down. However, it is not just about numbers. It’s about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll at the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory. It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage. So, I think what matters in this election is can you bring in those rural and suburban areas, particularly in the Midwest? And number two, what will you do when you get there?</p>,\n",

A bill I led, so taxpayers are no longer going to have to pay for people that harass other people. I have passed the law for drug shortages. I have done work in our rural areas. I think that’s what most matters to people. I would be so proud to be the first woman president, but mostly I want to be a president that gets things done and improves people’s lives.</p>,\n",

I believe that President Obama was talking about who has power in America, whose voices get heard.

And for me, the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020. I made the decision when I decided to run not to do business as usual. And now I’m crowding in on 100,000 selfies. That’s 100,000 hugs and handshakes and stories. Stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt, stories from people who can’t pay their medical bills, stories from people who can’t find childcare. Now, most of the people on the stage run a traditional campaign and that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up 5,000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken, in order to have a conversation, and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador.</p>,\n",

We need everybody’s help in this fight. I’m not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat Donald Trump. We need Democrats who’ve been with us all along, yes, but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country.

Mr. Yang, we have a question here from a professor right here at Loyola Marymount. There are nearly 200,000 DACA recipients, so-called DREAMers, in the state of California more than any other state, including several students right here at LMU. If you win and you reinstate DACA through executive action, another president could just overturn it again. So, will you move on a permanent legislative fix for DREAMers in your first 100 days if elected?</p>,\n",

I’m the son of immigrants myself and I know that DREAMers are essentially Americans in everything but this legal classification. I just want to return to this conversation because I think it’s core. Our country is deeply misogynist and most all of us know that. Money and men are tied together. That’s where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. Strong men treat women well for the same reasons. I’m on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons.</p>,\n",

If we were to put a hundred democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of 5% contributing, you’d see that rate skyrocket to 50 or 60% and you’d have many, many more women who would run for office because they don’t have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave.</p>,\n",

Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic. And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with. If you go to the factory in Michigan, it’s not wall to wall immigrants. It’s wall to wall robot arms and machines. We have to send the opposite message of this administration and, as your a president, I think I could send a very clear message, where if you’re considering immigrating to this country and I’m the president, you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States.

That is what the people of our country want. Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win reelection by dividing us up.

Not everyone did, but most of the Democrats did. Then I was on the judiciary committee when President Obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform.

He’s been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if in fact white people lose control of this country, that they’re going to lose control of their lives. And as somebody who lives in a majority-minority state, which is California, what he’s doing is so wrong on so many different levels. I agree with Senator Sanders. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human being on every right. This is a racial argument by a racist president who’s trying to divide us and who’s vilifying people. It’s absolutely wrong and it’s led him to break the laws of humanity in our name.</p>,\n",

Are you committing, as president, to financial compensation for those thousands of children?</p>,\n",

And on the larger issue of immigration, my understanding of this issue isn’t theoretical. It’s not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington. It begins with the fact that my household, my family came from abroad. My father immigrated to this country and became a U.S. Citizen. It comes from the fact that I’m the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life, largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants.</p>,\n",

I think what we have to do is what we do with social security, what we do with public education. Donald Trump’s kids can go to a public school, they should be able to go to a public school. What we all need right now is a revolution in education. We have got to en this dysfunctional childcare system and make that every working class person in this country can find high quality, affordable childcare.

And I want to make it clear that I’ve opposed many, many judges and I think everyone will remember what happened at the Kavanaugh Hearing when that nominee went after me.

As for the judge you just referred to, there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a, that went through the Senate unanimously with support by Senator Sanders with support by President Obama with support by then Senator Kennedy. So I think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they aren’t, but what would I do as president? I would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like Elena Kagan and justice Pryor and Sonia Sotomayor, and let’s not forget the notorious RBG. That’s what I would do.</p>,\n",

I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow, but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learn from when president Obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away, but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges.</p>,\n",

I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield, which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview, but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history.

You have pledged to withdrawal all U.S. troops from a Afghanistan within your first year as president. But the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country.

I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago and we’re still there. There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity.

I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9/11 but right now, she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage, to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when I am president, anytime if I am forced to deploy troops into war, anytime we seek an authorization, it will have a three year sunset. So that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it, it has to be brought to Congress, brought to the American people, and those members of Congress have to take that tough up or down vote.</p>,\n",

But the reality is that, if Republicans retain control of the U S Senate or even if Democrats win back a narrow Senate majority, your plan as constituted probably would not have the votes to pass Congress. So the question Senator is, if Congress rejects your plan and the American people are looking to you for leadership on this issue, are there smaller specific measures that you would take immediately to expand coverage and decrease costs as president?</p>,\n",

Which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as it’s charged in this country. Where the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing AIDS and does it at a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about.

Medicare, if you want to have Medicare.for reducing significantly the price of drugs, deductibles, et cetera by underwriting the plan to a tune of about $750 billion dollars.

And come to think of it, I should probably send my book around more to. Look. I think all of us want the same thing at the end of the day. We know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of The United States compared to what we’ve got. And we got to remember there. I don’t know how many, now we’re up to 25 something, have run for president in the democratic party. The moment we’ve got a nominee, the 24 who aren’t that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does. Let’s make sure there’s not too much to ask for forgiveness for by the time that day comes.</p>,\n",

I know that sometimes I get really worked up and sometimes I get a little hot. I don’t really mean to. What happens is when you do 100,000 selfies with people you hear enough stories about people who are really down to their last moments. I met someone just last week in Nevada, who said that he has diabetes and that he has access to a prescription because he’s a veteran. But his sister has diabetes, his daughter has diabetes, and they simply can’t afford insulin. So the three of them spend all of their time figuring out how to stretch one insulin prescription among three people. When I think about what we could do if we get a majority in the house, a majority in the Senate, and get back the white house, we could make this country work for people like that man.

We need a vision which says that in our great country, all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living, have health care, have the ability to send their kids to college regardless of their income.

It is a values check. It is a patriotism check. When you see people, and we’ve all had this happen, that come to our meetings and say yeah, I voted for Donald Trump but I don’t want to do it again because I want my kids to be able to watch the president on TV and not mute the TV. We have to remember as Democrats, and if I get worked up about this, it’s because I believe it’s so much in my heart, that we have to bring people with us and not shut them out.

So when I think about the gift that I’d like to give, and I’ve seen that too. I mean I think it starts with cruelty.

Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. We’re seeing record high levels of depression, suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger. Our way of life is changing faster than ever. And the simple fact is this, our politicians in D C succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington DC today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions?

It’s a tall order. And in order to do it, we’re going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined, not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side. I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multi generational coalition and I’m seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic party before, but belong here now, because they’re definitely not on board with what’s going on in the Trump white house.
