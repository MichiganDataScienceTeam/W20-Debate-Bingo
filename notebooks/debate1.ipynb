And I mean that. No, I mean that in a... That's what this debate is about, this is the best part of a debate like this. Congressman O'Rourke, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump, how speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the house. If the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller's report?\",\n \"1:42:17 Beto O'Rourke: Yes, and I'll tell you why.\",\n '1:42:18 Chuck Todd: How by the way? If the answer is yes.',\n \"1:42:23 Beto O'Rourke: One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States capital is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress, at the height of his power submitting to the rule of law and the will of people. That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years. If we set another precedent now, that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a President who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity, then we will have set a new standard. And that is that some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law. And we cannot allow that to stand. So we must begin impeachment now, so that we have the facts and the truth and we follow them as far as they go, and as high up as they reach, and we save this democracy. And if we've not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows, and under my administration, our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there's accountability and there's justice, it's the only way that we save this country.\",\n \"1:43:25 Chuck Todd: Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.\",\n \"1:43:27 Rachel Maddow: Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O'Rourke was just describing there, and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the house, it raises the prospect, and the Mueller report raises the prospect that President Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line. No US President has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office, do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?\",\n \"1:43:56 John Delaney: I guess there's always a first.\",\n '1:44:00 Rachel Maddow: Should he be the first?',\n \"1:44:00 John Delaney: I don't think anyone's above the law. I don't think anyone is above the law, including a President. I support speaker Pelosi's decisions that she's making in the House of Representatives right now, as speaker... I think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates, combined.\",\n '1:44:17 Rachel Maddow: Conceded. On the issue of prosecution...',\n \"1:44:18 John Delaney: But I do think... I do think that no one's above the law. And this president, who is lawless, should not be above the law. But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when you're out doing as much campaigning as I've done. 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number one issue the American people ask us about. It's not. They wanna know what we're gonna do for health care, how we're gonna lower pharmaceutical prices, how we're gonna build infrastructure, what we're gonna do to create jobs in their communities?\",\n \"1:44:46 John Delaney: You know, last year in our country, 80% of the money for start-up businesses went to 50 counties in this country. There's over 3000 counties in this country. That's what they care about, they care about what's going on in the public schools, they care about what's going on with jobs in their communities... With their pay, with their health care, with infrastructure... These are the issues, these kind of kitchen table pocketbook issues are actually what most Americans care about. They never ask about the Mueller report... They never ask about it. They want to know, how we're gonna solve these problems?\",\n \"1:45:11 Rachel Maddow: Understood. Congressman thank you. Congressman, thank you. Your time is up. Your time is up. You've hit time sir.\",\n '1:45:20 Chuck Todd: Here is the thing... I still, Senator we get...',\n '1:45:23 Amy Klobuchar: But if we let the Republicans run our elections...',\n '1:45:25 Chuck Todd: We got to...',\n \"1:45:25 Amy Klobuchar: And if we do not do something about Russian interference in the election, and we let Mitch McConnell stop all the backup paper ballots, then we're not gonna get what we want to do.\",\n \"1:45:34 Chuck Todd: I gotta sneak it up... But we blew through a break. Which is good news to give you more time. So I got a sneak one in now... More of this debate, it's picking up here. It continues right after this.\",\n '1:45:55 Rachel Maddow: We are going to start with something different tonight. This is one of those things that you have not been otherwise hearing about in the news, but stick with me.',\n '1:46:02 Speaker 3: Feed your mind with fresh perspective, get your favorite MSNBC shows. Now, as podcasts.',\n \"1:46:11 Steve Kornacki: Well, here it is... This is the month to start looking at, on your calendar February 2020 that's when all the talk ends, and the voting begins. And that massive, gigantic, enormous democratic presidential field, it gets thinned down, and maybe by the end of that month we'll even have a pretty good sense who the nominee is gonna be. Iowa always in that lead-off position. The Iowa caucus, there it is Monday, February 3rd, the race begins in Iowa. And then traditionally, it is an eight-day stretch from Iowa to New Hampshire. First caucus is in Iowa, first primary in New Hampshire eight days later. So you can expect however many candidates are left when they get to the starting line in Iowa, there's probably gonna be far fewer eight days later, between Iowa and New Hampshire. You can expect a lot of winnowing to take place, you'll have some clear candidates who are out in front as well.\",\n \"1:47:00 Steve Kornacki: Next up, this is a new one on the Democratic, a relatively new one. Only the last couple of cycles in Nevada, caucuses in Nevada. That's the next one, and then the big one, obviously the South Carolina primary, the first in the south, primary at the end of the month. And of course, South Carolina very important because this is the first state where you're gonna have a really substantial black population voting, 60%. More than 60% of the democratic electorate in the 2016 South Carolina primary, was African-American, so a key test there. Four individual contests, we'll talk only about these states the nights they come in. That's gonna be February. But then flip the calendar, from the last day of February. Look at this. Go into March, just a couple of days later, Super Tuesday.\",\n \"1:47:43 Steve Kornacki: Super Tuesday, let me give you a sense of what that looks like, massive, enormous. You go from one contest at a time, all the same... You got California, you got Texas, you got a bunch in the south, you got Massachusetts, Minnesota, all of these states. All at once. So, February is gonna produce some clarity in terms of who's a contender. Super Tuesday, mega primary. That could give us some real answers potentially in early March.\",\n \"1:48:10 S?: I've been fighting these companies my whole life.\",\n '1:48:12 S?: GreenCoat can cause cancer. [1:48:14] ____.',\n \"1:48:17 S?: So, that's where the law comes in.\",\n \"1:48:19 S?: If you fight for what's right, you can change the world.\",\n '1:48:27 Hoda Kotb: The Today Show has an updated mobile app. Catch up on segments from the show that you missed.

Live from Miami on NBC, MSNBC, Telemundo and NBC News Now.',\n \"1:49:00 Speaker 3: Don't miss night-two of the Democratic debate, as 10 more candidates battle it out. Tomorrow at 9:00 Eastern on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.\",\n \"1:49:17 Lester Holt: We are back from Miami and it's time now for closing statements. Each candidate has 45 seconds. We wanna begin with former Congressman Delaney.\",\n '1:49:27 John Delaney: Closing now?',\n '1:49:29 Lester Holt: Closing.',\n '1:49:29 John Delaney: Okay.',\n '1:49:29 Lester Holt: 45 seconds.',\n '1:49:32 Lester Holt: We could go on.',\n \"1:49:34 John Delaney: Together, we are on a mission. We're on a mission to find the America that's been lost. Lost through in-fighting, lost through inaction. We're so much better than this. We're a country that used to do things. We saved the world. We created the American dream for millions of people like myself; the grandson of immigrants, the son of a union electrician who went on to become a successful business leader and create thousands of jobs. But we did these things with real solutions, not with impossible promises, and those are the roots that we have to get back to. I'm running for president to solve these problems, to build infrastructure, to fix our broken health care system, to invest in communities that have been left behind, to improve public education. I just don't wanna be your president, to be your president.\",\n '1:50:23 Lester Holt: Congressman, your 45 seconds is over.',\n '1:50:23 John Delaney: I wanna be your president to do the job.',\n '1:50:26 Lester Holt: Thank you, sir.',\n '1:50:27 John Delaney: This is not about me. This is about getting America working again.',\n '1:50:31 Lester Holt: Thank you.',\n '1:50:33 Savannah Guthrie: Mayor de Blasio. Mayor, your closing statement.',\n \"1:50:37 Bill De Blasio: It matters. It matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn't just talk about it, but gave people $15 minimum wage. It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal health care. It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied Pre-K and gave it to every single one of them for free. These things really matter. And these are the things that I've done in New York, and I wanna do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first; it matters. We need to be that party again. Let's work together. With your help, we can put working people first again in America.\",\n '1:51:26 Savannah Guthrie: Thank you, Mayor De Blasio. Right on time.',\n '1:51:29 Josu00e9 Diaz-Balart: Governor Inslee, 45 seconds.',\n \"1:51:31 Jay Inslee: Trudi and I have three grandchildren, and we love them all. And when I was thinking about whether to run for President, I made a decision. I decided that on my last day on Earth, I wanted to look them in the eye and tell them I did everything humanly possible to protect them from the ravages of the climate crisis. And I know to a moral certainty, if we do not have the next President who commits to this as the top priority, it won't get done. And I am the only candidate; frankly, I'm surprised. I'm the only candidate who has made this commitment to make it the top priority. If you join me in that recognition of how important this is, we can have a unified national mission. We can save ourselves. We can save our children. We can save our grandchildren. And we can save, literally, the life on this planet. This is our moment.\",\n '1:52:26 Josu00e9 Diaz-Balart: Governor, thank you.',\n '1:52:26 Chuck Todd: Congressman Ryan, you have 45 seconds.',\n \"1:52:31 Tim Ryan: There's nothing worse than not being heard; nothing worse than not being seen. And I know that because I've represented, for 17 years in Congress, a forgotten community. They've tried to divide us, who's white, who's black, who's gay, who's straight, who's a man, who's a woman, and they ran away with all the gold, because they divided the working class. It's time for us to come together. I don't know how you feel, but I'm ready to play some offense. I come from the middle of industrial America, but these problems are all over our country. There's a tent city in LA, there's homeless people and people around our country who can't afford a home. It's time for us to get back on track. The teacher in Texas, the nurse in New Hampshire, the waitress in Wisconsin, all of us coming together, playing offense with an agenda that lifts everybody up.\",\n '1:53:23 Chuck Todd: Thank you, Congressman Ryan.',\n '1:53:23 Tim Ryan: I will only promise you one thing. When I walk into that Oval Office every morning, you will not be forgotten. Your voice will be heard.',\n '1:53:33 Chuck Todd: Thank you, Congressman.',\n '1:53:33 Tim Ryan: Thank you.',\n '1:53:34 Rachel Maddow: Congresswoman Gabbard, you have 45 seconds for your closing.',\n \"1:53:37 Tulsi Gabbard: Our nation was founded on the principles of service above self, people who fled kings who literally prospered on the backs and the sacrifices of people, coming here to this country, instead putting in place a government that is of, by, and for the people. But that's not what we have. Instead, we have a government that is of, by, and for the rich and powerful. This must end. As President, our White House, our White House will be a beacon of light, providing hope and opportunity, ushering in a new century, where every single person will be able to get the health care they need, where we will have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, where we will have good paying jobs and a new green economy. Join me in ushering in this new century with peace, prosperity, opportunity and justice for all.\",\n '1:54:32 Rachel Maddow: Congresswoman, thank you.',\n '1:54:33 Lester Holt: Secretary Castro, you have 45 seconds, sir.',\n '1:54:36 Juliu00e1n Castro: Me llamo JuliÃ¡n Castro, y estoy postulando por presidente de los Estados Unidos.',\n '1:54:42 Juliu00e1n Castro: The very fact that I can say that tonight shows the progress that we have made in this country. Like many of you, I know the promise of America. My grandmother came here when she was seven years old as an immigrant from Mexico, and just two generations later, one of her grandsons is serving the United States Congress and the other one is running for President of the United States.',\n \"1:55:03 Juliu00e1n Castro: If I am elected president, I will work hard every single day, so that you and your family can get good health care, your child can get a good education, and that you can have good job opportunities, whether you live in a big city or a small town. And on January 20th, 2021, we'll say adios to Donald Trump.\",\n '1:55:23 S?: [1:55:23] ____.',\n '1:55:23 Savannah Guthrie: Senator Klobuchar, the floor is yours.',\n \"1:55:26 Amy Klobuchar: Three things to know about me. First, I listen to people, and that's how I get things done. That is my focus. I have a track record of passing over 100 bills where I'm the lead Democrat and that is because I listened and I acted, and think that's important in a President. Everything else just melts away. Secondly, I'm someone that can win and beat Donald Trump. I have won every place, every race, and every time. I have won in the reddest of districts, ones had Donald Trump won by over 20 points. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa, and in Michigan.\",\n \"1:56:01 Amy Klobuchar: And finally, yeah, I am not the establishment party candidate. I've got respect, but I'm not that person. I am the one that doesn't have a political machine that doesn't come from money, and I don't make all the promises that everyone up here makes, but I can promise you this, I am going to govern with integrity, I'm gonna have your back and I'm gonna govern for you.\",\n '1:56:20 Savannah Guthrie: Thank you, Senator.',\n \"1:56:26 Cory Booker: Gracias. 50 years ago this month, my family moved into the town I grew up in, because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin, it was activists, mostly white activists, that stood up and fought for them. That's the best of who we are as America and why, when I got out of law school, I moved into the inner city of Newark to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people's rights. I've taken on bullies, and beat them. I've taken on tough fights and we've won, and we win those fights, not by showing the worst of who we are, but rising to who's best. Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms. We will beat him. I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again. This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him, but it's also a referendum on us, who we are, and who we must be to each other. It's time we win this election, and the way I'll govern is by showing the best of who we are because that's what this country needs and deserves. Thank you.\",\n '1:57:23 Josu00e9 Diaz-Balart: Senator, thank you.',\n \"1:57:23 Chuck Todd: Congressman O'Rourke. 45 seconds.\",\n \"1:57:27 Beto O'Rourke: Our daughter Molly turned 11 this week. I'm on this stage for her, for children across this country, including some her same age who've been separated from their parents and are sleeping on concrete floors under aluminum blankets tonight. If we're gonna be there for them, if we're gonna confront the challenges that we face, we can't return to the same old approach. We're gonna need a new kind of politics, one directed by the urgency of the next generation. Those climate activists who are fighting, not just for their future, but for everyone's. Those students marching, not just for their lives, but for all of ours. We'll need a movement like the one that we led in Texas. It renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in and writing nobody off. That's how we beat Donald Trump. That's how we bring this great country together again. Join us. This is our moment and the generations that follow are counting on us to meet it.\",\n '1:58:20 Chuck Todd: Thank you, Congressman.',\n '1:58:23 Rachel Maddow: Senator Warren, you have 45 seconds for the final, final statement of the evening.',\n \"1:58:27 Elizabeth Warren: Thank you. It's a great honor to be here. Never in a million years did I think I would stand on a stage like this. I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers; they all joined the military. I had a dream growing up, and my dream was to be a public school teacher. By the time I graduated from high school, my family... My family didn't have the money for a college application, much less a chance for me to go to college. But I got my chance. It was a $50 a semester commuter college. That was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl and it opened my life. I am in this fight because I believe that we can make our government, we can make our economy, we can make our country work, not just for those at the top. We can make it work for everyone. And I promise you this, I will fight for you as hard as I fight for my own family.\",\n '1:59:24 Rachel Maddow: Senator, thank you.',\n \"1:59:26 Savannah Guthrie: We would like to thank all of the candidates who participated with us tonight and that will do it for night one of this two night event, and guess what? We've got 10 more candidates tomorrow night.\",\n \"1:59:37 Lester Holt: We certainly hope you will join us then, but for now, that concludes our coverage of this first democratic debate from Miami. For Savannah, Jose, Chuck, and Rachel, I'm Lester Holt. Have a good night, everyone.\"]"
